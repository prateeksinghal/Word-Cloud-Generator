Obesity is increasing in prevalence in the United States with over 65% of adults considered overweight and 16% of children with BMI &gt; 95 percentile. The heritability of obesity is estimated between 40% and 70%, but the genetics of obesity for most individuals are complex and involve the interaction of multiple genes and environment. There are however several syndromic and non-syndromic forms of obesity that are monogenic and oligogenic that provide insight into the underlying molecular control of food intake and the neural networks that control ingestive behavior and satiety to regulate body weight and which may interact with treatment exposures to produce or exacerbate obesity in childhood cancer survivors.
