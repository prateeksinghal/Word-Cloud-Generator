An update of the human obesity gene map incorporating published results up to the end of October 1998 is presented. Evidence from the human obesity cases caused by single gene mutations; other Mendelian disorders exhibiting obesity as a clinical feature; quantitative trait loci uncovered in human genome-wide scans and in crossbreeding experiments with mouse, rat, and pig models; association and case-control studies with candidate genes; and linkage studies with genes and other markers is reviewed. The most noticeable changes from the 1997 update is the number of obesity cases due to single gene mutations that increased from three cases due to mutations in two genes to 25 cases due to 12 mutations in seven genes. A look at the obesity gene map depicted in Figure 1 reveals that putative loci affecting obesity-related phenotypes are found on all but chromosome Y of the human chromosomes. Some chromosomes show at least three putative loci related to obesity on both arms (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 17, 19, 20, and X) and several on one chromosome arm only (4q, 5q, 10q, 12q, 13q, 15q, 16p, and 22q). The number of genes and other markers that have been associated or linked with human obesity phenotypes is increasing very rapidly and now approaches 200.
