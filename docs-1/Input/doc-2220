Body weight regulation is a complex phenotype also depending on the action of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) that mediate the &quot;uncoupling&quot; of respiration leading to the dissipation of energy as heat. This study investigated whether genetic variants in the genes encoding UCP-1 and UCP-3 are associated with different obesity-related phenotypes in 162 whites with a wide range of body mass index. All subjects were genotyped for the polymorphisms UCP-1 A-3826G, UCP-1 Ala64Thr, and UCP-3 C-55T using a PCR-based restriction method with appropriate enzymes. The frequencies of the UCP-1 3826G, UCP-1 64Thr, and UCP-3 55T alleles were 27.2%, 12.0%, and 22.8%, respectively. No significant associations were observed between polymorphism and body mass index or obesity. However, after adjustment for gender, age, body mass index, and diabetes mellitus the waist-to-hip ratio was significantly associated with UCP-1 Ala64Thr ( P=0.003) and UCP-3 C-55T ( P=0.02) but not with UCP-1 A-3826G. The higher waist-to-hip ratios associated with the UCP-1 64Thr and UCP-3 55T alleles were due to higher waist circumference in these allele carriers. In conclusion, central obesity in whites as reflected by an increased waist-to-hip ratio is associated with the UCP-1 Ala64Thr and UCP-3 C-55T polymorphisms. To what extent these genotypes contribute to the overall cardiovascular risk remains to be elucidated.
