Do genetic (G), or environmental (E), factors primarily determine blood lipid concentrations in the Geneva population? On-going research on the causes of hypercholesterolemia in populations based on data collected by the Bus Sant√© Survey is summarized. About 2/3 of the HDL-cholesterol variance could not be explained by the most important 5 of 10 environmental factors and 9 of 275 common genetic variants identified in the analyses. The remaining 1/3 of the variance was explained mainly by obesity, smoking, alcohol intake, age, and gender. The common polymorphisms played a much smaller role. GxG, GxE, and ExE interactions were the weakest determinants. Environmental factors appear to be the main determinants of hypercholesterolemia in populations. Measurement of genetic traits for clinical or public health purposes is currently not useful.
