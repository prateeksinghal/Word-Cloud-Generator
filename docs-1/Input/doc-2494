The identification of the genetic defect underlying the obese phenotype of the viable yellow mouse, ectopic overexpression of the agouti protein which acts as antagonist at the melanocortin-4 receptor, together with the demonstration that the brain melanocortin system was one major downstream effector pathway of leptin signaling has put forward melanocortin receptors as drug targets for obesity. The lack of compounds acting as melanocortin receptor antagonists was the reason why pharmacological studies had not recognized melanocortin receptors as important drug targets earlier. Blockade of brain melanocortin receptors results in increased food intake and body weight, whereas stimulation of the brain melanocortin system results in decreased food intake and activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by decreased body weight and food intake accompanied by changes in neuroendocrine systems such as strong activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Since agouti-related protein suppresses the activity of the melanocortin system, the AgRP gene was investigated as candidate gene in anorexia nervosa. One variant of the AgRP gene was associated with anorexia nervosa, thus putting forward melanocortin receptor blockade as putative pharmacotherapy. Investigating variations in candidate genes in disease populations appears to be a fruitful approach towards the identification of drug targets.
