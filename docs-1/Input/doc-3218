Some epidemiological studies have shown that serum total cholesterol increases with age. especially in women. On the other hand, the risk of coronary artery disease is smaller in women than in men. Earlier studies have shown that a small dense low density lipoprotein (LDL) is more atherogenic than a large LDL. We studied LDL size and apolipoprotein E (apo E) phenotypes in premenopausal and postmenopausal women and in men at the same age. In this study 342 subjects participating in a health screening study were examined. There were four subgroups: 40-year-old men (n = 85), 40-year-old women (n = 80), 70-year old men (n = 88) and 70-year-old women (n = 89). In the present study LDL size was larger (P &lt; 0.01) in women (26.39 +/- 0.07 nm) than in men (25.95 +/- 0.07 nm). We found that LDL size correlated highly positively (r = 0.606; P &lt; 0.001) with serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration and inversely with serum triglyceride concentration (r = -0.627; P &lt; 0.001). Measuring serum HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in health screening studies gives information indirectly about LDL size and its atherogenicity. Apo E phenotype was not significantly associated with serum triglycerides, but was associated with LDL size, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. In our sample LDL size decreased and LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol increased according to the most prevalent apo E phenotypes in the order E2/3, E3/3, E3/4 and E4/4. Subjects with phenotype apo E4/4 had the smallest LDL size (25.70 +/- 0.19 nm), the highest total cholesterol (6.53 +/- 0.35 mmol/l) and the lowest HDL cholesterol values (1.28 +/- 0.04 mmol/l). We conclude that there was a significant interaction between sex and age in serum total cholesterol which was highest in older women. However, their LDL size was larger and their LDL is less atherogenic. Apo E phenotype had a significant influence on LDL size.
