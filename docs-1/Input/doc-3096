Progress in understanding the genetics of obesity has moved rapidly in the past few years. The genes for all of the single gene defects that produce obesity in experimental animals have now been cloned. The new insights from these models are one spur for the examination of possible links to human obesity. In thinking about the biology of obesity produced by single gene defects, it must be kept in mind that adrenalectomy can prevent the phenotypic expression in all of the single gene models of obesity. Thus, nongenetic components can play a major role in regulating even single gene models of obesity. Transgenic mice have also expanded our understanding of obesity. Transgenic models that both increase and decrease body fat have been published. Of particular interest from the perspective of the physiological control of obesity is the destruction of the uncoupling protein in brown adipose tissue, which is followed by hyperphagia and obesity, suggesting that the sympathetic nervous system is involved in both modulation of food intake and energy storage. Gene mapping using quantitative trait loci and studies of candidate genes have been applied to experimental models of animals with differing susceptibilities to dietary fat and have been applied to the human genome in more detail.
