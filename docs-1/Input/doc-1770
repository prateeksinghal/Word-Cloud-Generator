The development of effective cancer preventive interventions is being enhanced by the use of relevant animal models to confirm, refine, and extend potential leads from clinical and epidemiologic studies. In particular, genetically altered mice, with specific cancer-related genes modulated, are providing powerful tools for studying carcinogenesis, as well as important conduits for translating basic research findings from the laboratory bench to the bedside. This review explores the utility of genetically altered mice for developing cancer preventive strategies that can offset increased cancer susceptibility resulting from specific genetic lesions. Examples will focus on preventing cancer by dietary interventions, particularly obesity prevention/energy balance modulation, as well as chemoprevention, in mice with alterations in genes such as the p53 or Apc tumor suppressors, components of the ErbB pathway, and other pathways frequently altered in human cancer.
