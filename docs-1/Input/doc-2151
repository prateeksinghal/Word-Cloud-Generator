The incidence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions within industrial societies; however, research on human obesity has been hampered by our inability to control genetic and environmental factors. The control of energy homeostasis appears to be conserved among species. Recent creative research in Caenorhabditis elegans, including the application of a genome-wide RNA interference analysis, has provided insight into the genes involved in energy balance. In this article, we discuss the results of these studies and their potential importance to humans.
