Thyroid hormones exert most of their physiological effects through two thyroid hormone receptor (TR) subtypes, TRalpha and TRbeta, which associate with many transcriptional coregulators to mediate activation or repression of target genes. The search for selective TRbeta ligands has been stimulated by the finding that several pharmacological actions mediated by TRbeta might be beneficial in medical conditions such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. Here, we present a new methodology which employs surface plasmon resonance to investigate the interactions between TRbeta ligand binding domain (LBD) complexes and peptides derived from the nuclear receptor interaction motifs of two of its coregulators, SRC2 and DAX1. The effect of several TRbeta ligands, including the TRbeta selective agonist GC-1 and the TRbeta selective antagonist NH-3, were investigated. We also determined the kinetic rate constants for the interaction of TRbeta-T3 with both coregulators, and accessed the thermodynamic parameters for the interaction with DAX1. Our findings suggest that flexibility plays an important role in the interaction between the receptor and its coregulators, and point out important aspects of experimental design that should be addressed when using TRbeta LBD and its agonists. Furthermore, the methodology described here may be useful for the identification of new TRbeta ligands.
