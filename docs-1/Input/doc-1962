Stanniocalcin (STC)-2 was discovered by its primary amino acid sequence identity to the hormone STC-1. The function of STC-2 has not been examined; thus we generated two lines of transgenic mice overexpressing human (h)STC-2 to gain insight into its potential functions through identification of overt phenotypes. Analysis of mouse Stc2 gene expression indicates that, unlike Stc1, it is not highly expressed during development but exhibits overlapping expression with Stc1 in adult mice, with heart and skeletal muscle exhibiting highest steady-state levels of Stc2 mRNA. Constitutive overexpression of hSTC-2 resulted in pre- and postnatal growth restriction as early as embryonic day 12.5, progressing such that mature hSTC-2-transgenic mice are approximately 45% smaller than wild-type littermates. hSTC-2 overexpression is sometimes lethal; we observed 26-34% neonatal morbidity without obvious dysmorphology. hSTC-2-induced growth retardation is associated with developmental delay, most notably cranial suture formation. Organ allometry studies show that hSTC-2-induced dwarfism is associated with testicular organomegaly and a significant reduction in skeletal muscle mass likely contributing to the dwarf phenotype. hSTC-2-transgenic mice are also hyperphagic, but this does not result in obesity. Serum Ca2+ and PO4 were unchanged in hSTC-2-transgenic mice, although STC-1 can regulate intra- and extracellular Ca2+ in mammals. Interestingly, severe growth retardation induced by hSTC-2 is not associated with a decrease in GH or IGF expression. Consequently, similar to STC-1, STC-2 can act as a potent growth inhibitor and reduce intramembranous and endochondral bone development and skeletal muscle growth, implying that these tissues are specific physiological targets of stanniocalcins.
