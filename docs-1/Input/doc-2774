The goal of this article is to provide a perspective on how research involving the acute and chronic effects of exercise (referred to as &quot;exercise sciences&quot;) on the structure and function of organs systems will evolve in the next century. Within the last 30 years, exercise-related research has rapidly transitioned from an organ to a subcellular/molecular focus. Thus future research will continue to be heavily influenced by molecular biology tools, fueled by both emerging technologies (e.g., &quot;gene-chip microarrays&quot;) designed to dissect gene function on a macro scale as well as by the completion of the human genome project in which the approximately 80,000 genes comprising humans will be completely sequenced. These successes will drive the emerging fields of functional genomics (the dissecting of a gene's identity and function) and proteomics (the study of the properties of proteins). Funding levels at the National Institutes of Health will likely increase in order to expand these emerging fields as well as provide avenues for translating fundamental knowledge into solving the complexities of a number of degenerative diseases influenced heavily by activity/inactivity factors such as cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes, obesity, and the debilitating disorders associated with aging. Thus there are many challenges facing future exercise scientists who must harness the new technologies and take an aggressive stance in bringing this important field to the forefront.
