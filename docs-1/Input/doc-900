Glycerol kinase (GK) is at the interface of fat and carbohydrate metabolism and has been linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GK in fat metabolism and insulin signaling in skeletal muscle (an important end organ tissue in T2DM). Microarray analysis determined that there were 525 genes that were differentially expressed (1.2-fold, p value&lt;0.05) between knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed the differential expression of genes including glycerol kinase (Gyk), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit, polypeptide 1 (p85 alpha) (Pik3r1), insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1), and growth factor receptor bound protein 2-associated protein 1 (Gab1). Network component analysis demonstrated that transcription factor activities of myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD), myogenic regulatory factor 5 (MYF5), myogenin (MYOG), nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 (NUR77) are decreased in the Gyk KO whereas the activity of paired box 3 (PAX3) is increased. The activity of MYOD was confirmed using a DNA binding assay. In addition, myoblasts from Gyk KO had less ability to differentiate into myotubes compared to WT myoblasts. These findings support our previous studies in brown adipose tissue and demonstrate that the role of Gyk in muscle is due in part to its non-metabolic (moonlighting) activities.
