Ghrelin, an acylated peptide secreted from the stomach, acts as a short-term signal of nutrient depletion. Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand for the GH secretagogue receptor 1a, a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary. We used a synthetic oligonucleotide, NOX-B11-2, capable of specific high-affinity binding to bioactive ghrelin to determine whether ghrelin neutralization would alter indices of energy balance in vivo. This novel type of ghrelin-blocking agent, called an RNA Spiegelmer (SPM), is a polyethylene glycol-modified l-RNA oligonucleotide, the nonnatural configuration of which confers in vivo stability. NOX-B11-2 blocked ghrelin mediated activation of GH secretagogue receptor 1a in cell culture (IC50 approximately 5 nm). We explored the effects of acute NOX-B11-2 administration on ghrelin-induced feeding in mice. NOX-B11-2 (66 mg/kg, sc) blocked ghrelin-induced feeding and was without effect on feeding evoked by an orally active nonpeptide ghrelin receptor agonist. We demonstrated that selective ghrelin blockade effectively promoted weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Chronic infusion of NOX-B11-2 (33 mg/kg.d, sc) to DIO mice evoked body weight loss for 13 d and reduced food intake and fat mass relative to control SPM-infused mice. In a 7-d study, DIO mice infused with NOX-B11-2 (33 mg/kg.d, sc) showed body weight loss, compared with animals receiving control SPM. This effect was directly mediated by SPM neutralization of ghrelin because NOX-B11-2 administration to ghrelin-deficient mice resulted in no weight loss. The decreased obesity observed in SPM-treated DIO mice provides validation for ghrelin neutralization as a potential antiobesity therapy.
