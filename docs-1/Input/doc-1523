The intestinal fatty acid-binding protein gene is proposed as a candidate gene for diabetes because the protein it codes is involved in fatty acid absorption and metabolism. This study investigates the association of the Ala54Thr variant of the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein gene on type 2 diabetes mellitus and other related metabolic traits in Asian Indians. Ala54Thr polymorphism was genotyped by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in unrelated 773 type 2 diabetic and 899 normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) subjects, randomly chosen from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study, an ongoing population-based study in South India. The Ala54Thr polymorphism was not associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus or obesity. However, genotype-phenotype study revealed that the NGT subjects carrying the Thr54 allele had significantly higher 2-hour plasma glucose (P = .007), glycated hemoglobin (P = .004), 2-hour insulin (P = .027), and fasting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = .032) levels compared with those with the Ala54 allele. Normal glucose-tolerant subjects with Ala54Thr and Thr54Thr genotypes had significantly higher fasting serum triglyceride levels (P = .003) compared with those with Ala54Ala. The subjects were stratified into those with hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride levels &gt;or=150 mg/dL) and those without. The odds ratio for hypertriglyceridemia for the individuals carrying the Ala54Thr genotype was 1.491 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-1.83, P &lt; .0001), and for those carrying the Thr54Thr genotype, it was 1.888 (95% CI, 1.34-2.67; P &lt; .0001). Subjects were also stratified into those with metabolic syndrome (MS) and those without, according to modified Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. The odds ratio (adjusted for age and sex) for MS for the individuals carrying the Ala54Thr genotype was 1.240 (95% CI, 1.02-1.51; P = .03), whereas for those carrying the Thr54Thr genotype, it was 1.812 (95% CI, 1.28-2.57; P = .001). Carriers of the Thr54 allele have associations with MS and hypertriglyceridemia in this urban South Indian population.
