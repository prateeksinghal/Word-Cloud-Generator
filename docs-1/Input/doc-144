Evidence for a functional role for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in adipose tissue is demonstrated in dynamic changes in expression of ECM genes during adipocyte differentiation and in obesity. Components of the ECM may regulate adipose cell number expansion by restricting pre-adipocyte proliferation, regulating apoptosis and inhibiting adipogenesis. Although pre-adipocytes express multiple proteoglycans, their role in pre-adipocyte proliferation up to now has remained unknown. The study described here was conducted to characterize roles of small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) in adipocyte proliferation. Pre-adipocytes were seeded on plates coated with biglycan and decorin and were allowed to differentiate. In addition, pre-adipocytes were incubated on plates coated with biglycan, decorin, or fibronectin and measurements were made of cell proliferation and apoptosis. We are able to report that SLRPs decorin and biglycan did not affect differentiation of our 3T3-L1 cells; however, biglycan and decorin did reduce proliferation of pre-adipocytes, partly by induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, anti-proliferative capabilities of decorin and biglycan were nullified with removal of GAG side-chains suggesting that the chains played key roles in anti-proliferative effects of the SLRPs. We also found that co-treatment of decorin or biglycan with the proteoglycan fibronectin restored normal proliferation, an indication that multiple ECM proteins may act in concert to regulate overall proliferation rates of pre-adipocytes. These studies indicate that SLRPs may compose a regulatory factor in adipose tissue expansion, through hyperplasia.
