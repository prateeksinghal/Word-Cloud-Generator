Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a member of the family of mitochondrial carrier proteins, has been implicated in the control of whole-body energy balance. The coding region of the human UCP2 gene has now been shown to comprise six exons, and the sequences of the exon-intron boundaries were determined. With the use of this sequence information, 25 Japanese patients with obesity and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and 25 subjects with simple obesity were screened for mutations in the entire coding region of UCP2 by PCR and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Two nucleotide polymorphisms resulting in Ala55 --&gt; Val and Ala232 --&gt; Thr substitutions were detected. With the use of PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, the allele frequencies for each of these polymorphisms were determined in 210 Japanese patients with NIDDM, 42 obese individuals, and 218 normal control subjects. The frequency of the Val55 allele did not differ significantly among the NIDDM group (46.0%), the obesity group (48.8%), and the normal control group (48.4%). The Thr232 allele was detected in only three subjects, who were heterozygotes and in the NIDDM group (allele frequency, 0.7%). However, expression in yeast of the human wild-type UCP2 protein and UCP2 containing Thr232 revealed no difference in functional activity. These results indicate that the Ala55 --&gt; Val and Ala232 --&gt; Thr variants of UCP2 do not play an important role in the pathogenesis of NIDDM or obesity in the Japanese population.
