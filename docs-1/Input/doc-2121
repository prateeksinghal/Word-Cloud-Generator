Lipid accumulation is associated with cardiac dysfunction in diabetes and obesity. Transgenic mice expressing non-transferable lipoprotein lipase (LpL) with a glycosylated phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor in cardiomyocytes have dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms responsible for lipid accumulation and cardiomyopathy are not clear. Hearts from 3-month-old mice expressing GPI-anchored human LpL (hLpLGPI) mice had increased fatty acid oxidation and heart failure genes and decreased glucose transporter genes. 6-month-old mice had increased mRNA expression and activation of the apoptosis marker caspase-3. Moreover, hLpLGPI hearts had significant cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol. Low density lipoprotein uptake was greater in hLpLGPI hearts, and this was associated with more intracellular apolipoprotein B (apoB). To test whether lipid accumulation in the hLpLGPI heart is reduced by cardiac expression of apoB, hLpLGPI mice were bred with transgenic human apoB (HuB)-expressing mice. Hearts of HuB/hLpLGPI mice had less triglyceride (38%) and free fatty acids (19%), secreted more apoB, and expressed less atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and more glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). The increased mortality of the mice was abrogated by the transgenic expression of apoB. Therefore, we hypothesize that cardiac apoB expression improves cardiomyopathy by increasing lipid resecretion from the heart.
