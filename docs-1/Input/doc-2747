Current agents for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus improve the metabolic profile but do not reinstate normality. They also reduce chronic diabetic complications, but they do not eliminate them. Thus, new agents with novel actions are required to complement and extend the capabilities of existing treatments. Insulin resistance and beta-cell failure, which are crucial components in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes, remain the underlying targets for new drugs. Recently introduced agents include a short-acting non-sulphonylurea insulin-releaser, repaglinide, which synchronizes insulin secretion with meal digestion in order to reduce post-prandial hyperglycaemia. The thiazolidinedione drugs, troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone represent a new class of agonists for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). PPARgamma increases the transcription of certain insulin-sensitive genes, thereby improving insulin sensitivity. The intestinal lipase inhibitor orlistat and the satiety-inducer sibutramine are new weight-reducing agents that may benefit glycaemic control in obese Type 2 diabetes patients. Several further new insulin-releasing agents, and agents to retard carbohydrate digestion and modify lipid metabolism stand poised to enter the market. The extent to which they will benefit glycaemic control remains to be seen. However, the prospect of permanently arresting or reversing the progressive deterioration of Type 2 diabetes continues to evade therapeutic capture.
