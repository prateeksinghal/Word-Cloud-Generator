The aim of this study was to investigate a series of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes MC2R, MC3R, MC4R, MC5R, POMC, and ENPP1 for association with obesity. Twenty-five SNPs (2-7 SNPs/gene) were genotyped in 246 Finns with extreme obesity (BMI &gt; or = 40 kg/m2) and in 481 lean subjects (BMI 20-25 kg/m2). Of the obese subjects, 23% had concomitant type 2 diabetes. SNPs and SNP haplotypes were tested for association with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Allele frequencies differed between obese and lean subjects for two SNPs in the ENPP1 gene, rs1800949 (P = 0.006) and rs943003 (P = 0.0009). These SNPs are part of a haplotype (rs1800949 C-rs943003 A), which was observed more frequently in lean subjects compared to obese subjects (P = 0.0007). Weaker associations were detected between the SNPs rs1541276 in the MC5R, rs1926065 in the MC3R genes and obesity (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively), and between SNPs rs2236700 in the MC5R, rs2118404 in the POMC, rs943003 in the ENPP1 genes and type 2 diabetes (P = 0.03, P = 0.02 and P = 0.02, respectively); these associations did not, however, remain significant after correction for multiple testing. In conclusion, a previously unexplored ENPP1 haplotype composed of SNPs rs1800949 and rs943003 showed suggestive evidence for association with adult-onset morbid obesity in Finns. In this study, we did not find association between the frequently studied ENPP1 K121Q variant, nor SNPs in the MCR or POMC genes and obesity or type 2 diabetes.
