The potential effect of variants in three catecholaminergic pathway genes (ADRB2, ADRB3, and GNB3) on obesity-related traits was investigated in an European-derived Brazilian population. Three-hundred and thirty-five individuals were screened for the ADRB2 Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, ADRB3 Trp64Arg, and GNB3 814G--&gt;A and 825C--&gt;T polymorphisms using PCR-based methods. The association of the polymorphisms with quantitative variables was tested separately in each sex by analysis of covariance using general linear models, including age as a covariate. Only the ADRB2 Arg16Gly polymorphism was associated with higher body mass index and waist circumference. This association was restricted to the male sample. As the number of studies increases, it becomes clear that the genetic bases of obesity are complex, with sex-specific effects a playing an important role in its etiology. In the context of this European-derived population, the ADRB2 gene accounts for a significant part of obesity-related phenotypes in males.
