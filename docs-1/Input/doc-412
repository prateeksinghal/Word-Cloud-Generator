This manuscript presents an overview of a symposium held at the 2009 annual meeting of the Environmental Mutagen Society (EMS) in St. Louis, MO. The symposium was sponsored by the Women in the Environmental Mutagen Society (WEMS) special interest group, and it covered current molecular genetics technologies and their impact on diagnosis and treatment of diseases that primarily or differentially affect women. Four speakers presented groundbreaking new information from such areas as cancer genetics, gene-environment interactions, epigenetics, DNA repair, and molecular epidemiology. Although cancer was a primary focus of the symposium, other health issues such as obesity and cardiovascular disease were addressed. The rapid evolution in genomic technologies discussed in this symposium should provide new tools to explore some of the critical questions raised by the research projects described in this article. This symposium demonstrates that EMS provides a forum for the presentation, discussion, and extension of the data generated by the investigators featured in this article and other researchers engaged in the study of the molecular mechanisms and gene-environment interactions that impact women's health.
