Prostacyclin (PGI(2)) is a key vascular protector, metabolized from endogenous arachidonic acid (AA). Its actions are mediated through the PGI(2) receptor (IP) and nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Here, we found that PGI(2) is involved in regulating cellular microRNA (miRNA) expression through its receptors in a mouse adipose tissue-derived primary culture cell line expressing a novel hybrid enzyme gene (COX-1-10aa-PGIS), cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and PGI(2) synthase (PGIS) linked with a 10-amino acid linker. The triple catalytic functions of the hybrid enzyme in these cells successfully redirected the endogenous AA metabolism toward a stable and dominant production of PGI(2). The miRNA microarray analysis of the cell line with upregulated PGI(2) revealed a significant upregulation (711, 148b, and 744) and downregulation of miRNAs of interest, which were reversed by antagonists of the IP and PPARγ receptors. Furthermore, we also found that the insulin-mediated lipid deposition was inhibited in the PGI(2)-upregulated adipocytes. The study also initiated a discussion that suggested that the endogenous PGI(2) inhibition of lipid deposition in adipocytes could involve miRNA-mediated inhibition of expression of the targeted genes. This indicated that PGI(2)-miRNA regulation could exist in broad pathophysiological processes involving PGI(2) (i.e., apoptosis, vascular inflammation, cancer, embryo implantation, and obesity).
