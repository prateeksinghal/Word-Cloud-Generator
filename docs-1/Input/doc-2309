Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. The disorder is characterized by clinical features of hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities and often central obesity and hyperinsulinaemia. PCOS may increase the risk for infertility, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular disease and endometrial cancer, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis of the syndrome. The genetic basis of PCOS is unknown. There is a strong familial component but the mode of inheritance is uncertain and several candidate genes have been proposed to contribute to susceptibility. Not only genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis have been studied but also genes associated with the regulation of insulin secretion and action since hyperinsulinaemia is a characteristic of PCOS. So far there is evidence that INS VNTR (insulin variable number of tandem repeats) or CYP11alpha (cholesterol side chain cleavage) genes are associated with this syndrome. PCOS appears, however, to be an oligogenic disorder and more studies are necessary to define the genetic basis.
