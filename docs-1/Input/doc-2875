The human homologues of recently discovered murine obesity genes provide relevant candidates to study the genetic component of obesity in humans. We analysed the human counterparts to murine obesity genes ob, db, agouti, tub, melanocortin 4-receptor (MC4-R) and mitochondrial uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2 and UCP3), as well as two other chromosomal regions reported to be linked to obesity-related phenotypes in restricted populations. We found no significant evidence for linkage to any analysed loci in our total study material of 105 affected sib pairs collected from the genetically homogenous population of Finland. However, several markers on 14 cM chromosomal region flanking the MC4-R gene showed sharing of alleles identical-by-descent (IBD) more frequently than expected. A selected subset of non-diabetic obese sib pairs strengthened the P values down to 0.003 in this particular region. The smallest P value (P = 0.001) was obtained with a marker D18S487 in a subgroup containing only sib pairs with one lean and one obese parent. We therefore screened seven obese subjects included in our sib pair material for sequence changes in their MC4-R gene, but no mutations of apparent causal relationship were found. In conclusion, we could not find evidence for significant contribution of the chromosomal loci corresponding to the murine single gene obesity genes for human morbid obesity, but additional studies are still needed to clarify whether DNA alterations within or adjacent to the MC4-R gene play some role.
