A family is described in which four male patients spanning three generations present a consistent clinical entity, the major features of which include: ulnar finger and fibular toe ray defects; delayed growth and onset of puberty, obesity, hypogenitalism and diminished sexual activity; hypoplasia of nipples and apocrine glands with subsequently diminished ability to perspire. Additional findings in single cases include pyloric, anal and subglottic stenosis. To date, another 12 patients in three families have been described with this syndrome. The condition appears to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with full penetrance and highly variable expression.
