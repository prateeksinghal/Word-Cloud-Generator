We investigated whether an association exists between genetic variants of the human obesity (OB or leptin) gene and body mass index (BMI) or weight in subjects with Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) and in age- and gender-matched lean and obese subjects without PWS. The study included 51 subjects with PWS (mean age = 17.7 +/- 9.5 years, BMI = 29.7 +/- 8.3 kg/m2); 50 non-PWS obese subjects (mean age = 18.2 +/- 10.8 years, BMI = 33.3 +/- 9.5 kg/m2); and 53 non-PWS lean subjects (mean age = 17.8 +/- 9.5 years, BMI = 19.5 +/- 2.9 kg/m2). Allele sizes were determined via standard polymerase chain reaction of the D7S1875 locus, a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism close to the OB gene and classified as trichotomous (homozygous &lt; 208 bp, heterozygous &lt; 208/ &gt; or = 208 bp, homozygous &gt; or = 208 bp) or dichotomous (homozygous &lt; 208 bp or not). Non-PWS males showed a marked decrease in weight with larger alleles while females did not (interaction effect, p &lt; 0.05). Comparable effects were not observed among the PWS subjects. Associations between BMI and genotype were statistically significant (r = 0.22, one-tailed p &lt; 0.05) and comparable to previous research among the non-PWS subjects &lt; 18 years, but not the adults (r = 0.05, one-tailed p = 0.38). Correlations were not statistically significant among either the adult or non-adult PWS subjects.
