Low concentrations of adiponectin, the protein product of the APM1 gene, have been reported to be associated with obesity and insulin resistance. However, contrasting results have been described on the genetic variability in APM1 and characteristics of the metabolic syndrome and adiponectin serum concentrations. In the present study, we investigated the association of the two most well-known SNPs of APM1 (+45T&gt;G and +276G&gt;T) and their haplotypes, with serum adiponectin concentrations, metabolic parameters and intima-media thickness of the carotid arteries in 1,745 well-phenotyped asymptomatic unrelated Caucasian subjects of the SAPHIR cohort. The common T-allele (88.5%) of SNP +45T&gt;G and the common G-allele (70.5%) of SNP +276G&gt;T were associated with significantly lower serum adiponectin levels (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.00005, respectively). The most frequent haplotype TG (59.0%) defined by both loci showed a strong association with lower serum adiponectin concentrations (P = 0.000000002). A clear effect per copy of the respective haplotype was observed. This association was most pronounced in lean and insulin-sensitive subjects. The two less common haplotypes TT (29.5%) and GG (11.5%) were associated with higher serum adiponectin levels in a dose-dependent association. Interestingly, no significant association between the adiponectin 45-276 haplotypes and the majority of parameters of the metabolic syndrome or intima-media thickness of the carotid arteries was found in our study. In summary, we replicated a strong association of the adiponectin 45-276 genotypes and haplotypes with adiponectin levels in healthy Caucasians. However, we could not confirm an association of this gene locus with metabolic parameters of the insulin resistance syndrome.
