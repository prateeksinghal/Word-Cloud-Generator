Differences among ethnic and racial groups in obesity-related traits have been clearly established in the scientific literature. To explore the genetic component underlying these differences, the genetic admixture approach has been used. In this approach, ancestry informative genetic markers are used to estimate a quantitative value representing the degree of ancestral background in individuals of admixed genetic background. Genetic admixture has been successfully used to explain racial and ethnic variation in obesity related traits; however, the understanding and measure of cultural and environmental components that also influence these phenotypes still requires further exploration.
