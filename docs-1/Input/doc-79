The quantitative traits of mass and percentage of abdominal fat in chicken and various types of obesity in mammals are homologous and functionally similar. Therefore, the genes involved in obesity development in humans and laboratory rodents as well as those responsible for pig lard thickness could be involved in abdominal fat deposition in broilers. Expression of candidate genes FABP1, FABP2, FABP3, HMGA1, MC4R, PPARG, PPARGC1A, POMC and PTPN1 was studied in fat, liver, colon, muscle, hypophysis, and brain in chicken (broilers) using real-time PCR. Significant difference in the HMGA1 gene expression in the liver of broiler chicken with high (3.5 +/- 0.18%) and low (1.9 +/- 0.56%) abdominal fat concentration has been revealed. The expression of this gene was been shown to correlate with the amount (0.7, P &lt; or = 0.01) and mass (0.7, P &lt; or = 0.01) of abdominal fat. The PPARG gene expression in liver in the same chicken subsets was also significantly different. Correlation coefficients of the gene expression with the abdominal fat amount and mass were respectively 0.55 (P &lt; or = 0.05) and 0.57 (P &lt; or = 0.01). Based on these results, we suggest that the HMGA1 and PPARG genes are involved in abdominal fat deposition. The search for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HMGA and PPARG regulatory regions could facilitate identifying genetic markers for broiler breeding according to the mass and percentage of abdominal fat.
