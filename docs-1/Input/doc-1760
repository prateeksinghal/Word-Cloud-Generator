The combined effect of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) Pro/Ala and interleukin-6 G174C gene variants, was evaluated in 429 Caucasian subjects in order to determine whether subjects carrying both variants were at different risk for obesity. In particular, the combined contribution of these two variants (both independent and interaction effects) to the total variation of obesity-related factors was estimated. All subjects were genotyped for codon 12 Pro/Ala locus variability and for the interleukin-6-174 C/G promoter polymorphism. Subjects with the Ala variant had significantly lower BMI, insulin resistance, triglyceride levels than those without. Furthermore, subjects with Ala variant had significantly lower IL-6 levels (0.88 +/- 0.9 vs 1.61 +/- 2.25 pg/ml; p = 0.041). In contrast, the IL6-C variant was significantly associated with lower plasma IL-6 and with lower total cholesterol levels but was not significantly associated with any other obesity risk factors. Indeed, subjects carrying both PPARG and IL-6 gene variants, had a clearly more favourable profile of obesity related risk factors than subjects with one variant, having Ala+/C+ carriers lower BMI (22.8 +/- 2.3 vs 24.14 +/- 1.9; f = 5.31; p &lt; 0.005), insulin resistance (1.49 +/- 0.70 vs 2.13 +/- 0.92; f = 4.342; p = 0.038) and triglyceride levels (79.15 +/- 32.9 vs 98 +/- 6.73 mg/dl; f = 3.120; p &lt; 0.005). These findings suggest that the effect of the two genetic variants on 'obesity related' factors is additive.
