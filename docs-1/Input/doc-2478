Although rapid globalization of the Westernized way of life is responsible for the large rise in the number of obesity cases (about 1 billion individuals are now overweight or frankly obese), obesity is a typical common multifactorial disease in that environmental and genetic factors interact, resulting in a disease state. There is strong evidence for a genetic component to human obesity: e.g., the familial clustering (the relative risk among siblings being 3-7) and the high concordance of body composition in monozygotic twins. However, the role of genetic factors in many human obesities (referred to as &quot;common obesity&quot; in this review) is complex, being determined by interaction of several genes (polygenic), each of which may have relatively small effects (i.e., they are &quot;susceptibility&quot; genes and work in combination with each other as well as with environmental factors such as nutrients, physical activity, and smoking).
