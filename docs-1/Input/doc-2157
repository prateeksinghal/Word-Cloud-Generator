Insulin resistance is common and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Precedents in biomedical research indicate that evaluation of monogenic syndromes can help to understand a common complex phenotype. Monogenic forms of insulin resistance, such as familial partial lipodystrophy, which results from mutations in either LMNA (encoding lamin A/C) or PPARG (encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma), and congenital generalized lipodystrophy, which results from mutations in either AGPAT2 (encoding 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase) or BSCL2 (encoding seipin), can display features seen in the common metabolic syndrome. In addition, insulin resistance is seen in disorders associated with insulin receptor mutations, progeria syndromes and in inherited forms of obesity. Although insulin resistance in such rare monogenic syndromes could simply be secondary to fat redistribution and/or central obesity, the products of the causative genes might also produce insulin resistance directly, and might illuminate new causative mechanisms for insulin resistance in such common disorders as T2DM and obesity.
