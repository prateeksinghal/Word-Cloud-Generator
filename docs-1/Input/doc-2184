To understand how medium-chain fatty acids (FA) influence lipid metabolism in adipocytes, we studied the effects of octanoate on the oxidation of glucose and endogenous palmitate, cellular O(2) consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, lipid synthesis from long-chain FA, glucose and lactate. We found that octanoate significantly suppressed the esterification of oleate into triglycerides (TG) in both 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes. Octanoate also significantly suppressed de novo FA synthesis. These effects were associated with octanoate-mediated reductions in the activities of acyl CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). Cells pretreated with octanoate had reduced mRNA levels for a number of lipid metabolism genes, including of DGAT, ACC and stearoyl CoA desaturase-1. On the other hand, octanoate did not acutely perturb cellular O(2) consumption or mitochondrial membrane potential. Together, these results suggest that octanoate affected adipocyte function by reducing TG synthesis but not by enhancing oxidation.
