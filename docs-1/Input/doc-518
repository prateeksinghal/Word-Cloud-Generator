Microarray technology permits the interrogation of nearly all expressed genes under a wide range of conditions. Patterns of gene expression in response to obesity and diabetes have yielded important insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes and its relationship to obesity. In muscle, microarray studies have motivated research into mitochondrial function. In adipose tissue, clues have pointed to the importance of inflammation in obesity. New adipocyte-derived hormones involved in insulin resistance have been found; a notable example is retinol binding protein 4. In liver, genes responsive to master regulators of lipid metabolism have been identified. In beta-cells, genes involved in cell survival, cell proliferation, and insulin secretion have been identified. These studies have greatly expanded our understanding of mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of obesity-induced diabetes. When combined with genetic information, microarray data can be used to construct causal network models linking gene expression with disease.
