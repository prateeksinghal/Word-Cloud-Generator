Obesity-related genes were isolated and identified in these several years. Development of transgenic mice has clarified the molecular mechanisms of obesity. There have been reported point mutations of the genes correspond to leptin(ob-gene) and leptin receptor(db-gene). Thereby leptin is considered to be one of the most important regulators of energy metabolism also in human.
