The mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8), resistin (RETN), 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoform 1 (HSD11B1) and protein kinase B Akt2 (AKT2) genes are all genes known to affect insulin signalling and have been implicated in the progression of obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans. In this study, polymorphisms in the porcine diabetes related MAPK8, RETN, HSD11B1 and AKT2 genes were identified, mapped and their associations with phenotypic measurements in swine were analysed. Polymorphisms detected in the MAPK8, RETN and HSD11B1 loci were used to genotype a Berkshire-Yorkshire pig breed reference family. Using linkage analysis, RETN, HSD11B1 and MAPK8 genes were mapped to pig chromosomes 2, 9 and 14, respectively, while the AKT2 gene was physically mapped to pig chromosome 6q21. Results presented here suggest associations between the polymorphisms in the MAPK8, RETN and HSD11B1 genes with several phenotypic measurements, including fat deposition traits in the pig. Because these genes have been implicated in obesity and diabetes in humans, and this study suggests associations with fat related traits, further research on these genes in swine may provide useful information on genetic factors underlying lean pork production.
