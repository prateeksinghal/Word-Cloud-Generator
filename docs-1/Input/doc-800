The association of two cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) polymorphisms, D442G and TAQIB (B1--&gt;B2), with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in 932 Chinese obese individuals (BMI &gt;or= 27) was investigated in comparison with normal controls (BMI &lt;or= 24). Independent association was demonstrated for TAQIB minor allele B2 and CETP442 minor allele G with elevated HDL levels. The CETP D442G polymorphism was associated with a much greater increase in HDL levels in subjects with BMI exceeding 27 kg/m(2) (+5.42 mg/dl, P = 0.0007) compared to normal controls (+1.97 mg/dl, P = 0.275), and the increase in HDL reached the highest level among subjects with BMI exceeding 30 kg/m(2) (+6.80 mg/dl, P = 0.016). TAQIB showed significant association with HDL levels only in normal BMI subgroup (P = 0.0017). TAQIB significantly interacted with serum triglyceride (TG) on modulating HDL levels (P = 0.027). The TAQIB-TG interaction effect remained marginally significant after controlling for BMI (P = 0.057). We conclude that D442G polymorphism is associated with more HDL elevation in obesity. TAQIB interacts with serum TG on modulating HDL levels, and the interaction is partly independent of BMI.
