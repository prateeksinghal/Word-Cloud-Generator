The obstructive apnea syndrome (OSA) is considered as a complex genetic disorder. Descriptive studies from several countries have consistently show familial aggregation of the apnea-hypopnea index and symptoms of OSA in both adults and children. Phenotypic markers of OSA have been identifies such as upper airway anomalies, abnormal breathing control, and obesity through which genes might act to increase susceptibility to OSA. The genetics of OSA may differ among racial groups. Two approaches have recently been used to investigate the genetics of OSA: a segregation analysis and a whole genome scan. Data suggested a common causal pathway regulating both OSA and obesity in Caucasian families.
