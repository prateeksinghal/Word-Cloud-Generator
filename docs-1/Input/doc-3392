The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the influence of obesity on ischaemic heart disease frequency in a well-documented type II diabetic population. To eliminate one of the possible sources of variability for plasma lipid concentrations, only subjects showing the apoprotein E phenotype, indicative of homozygosity for the epsilon 3 allele (i.e. an E3/E3 genotype), have been recruited. A larger prevalence of ischaemic heart disease was noticed among obese patients as compared to non-obese or merely overweight subjects according to a higher frequency of hypertension and to higher triglyceride concentrations. These results corroborate the hypothesis of a common pathogenesis of the major cardiovascular risk factors.
