The skeletal muscle activity of protein tyrosine phosphates 1B (PTP1B), a modulator of insulin and IGF-1 signaling, is reduced in obese nondiabetic subjects and in subjects with type 2 diabetes in comparison with leaner, nondiabetic controls. PTP1B mRNA, like many other signaling molecules, including the insulin receptor, is alternatively spliced. Since we have shown that the ratio of the insulin receptor splice variants is modulated by insulin in vitro and is related to insulin levels in vivo, we hypothesized that the relative ratios of the alternatively spliced PTP1B mRNA might also vary in humans in proportion to the degree of hyperinsulinemia. This was tested in 21 nondiabetic Pima Indians, a population at increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The relative ratio of the PTP1B splice variants was quantified using RT-PCR of total RNA extracted from fractionated monocytes. The ratio of the splice variants was positively correlated with fasting plasma insulin concentration (r = 0.757; P = 0.0001), 2-h plasma insulin concentration following an oral glucose tolerance test (r = 0.614; P = 0.01, n = 16), and percentage of body fat (r = 0.746; P = 0.0001). These data indicate that variability in the ratio of the two splice variants is due, in part, to in vivo levels of chronic hyperinsulinemia. This simple, noninvasive assay is therefore a potential biomarker for chronic hyperinsulinemia, similar to the HbAlc assay in use to monitor glucose management in diabetic patients.
