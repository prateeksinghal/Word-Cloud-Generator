The effect of apolipoprotein (apo) E genotype on apoB-100 metabolism was examined in three normolipidemic apoE2/E2, five type III hyperlipidemic apoE2/E2, and five hyperlipidemic apoE3/E2 subjects using simultaneous administration of (131)I-VLDL and (125)I-LDL, and multi-compartmental modeling. Compared with normolipidemic apoE2/E2 subjects, type III hyperlipidemic E2/E2 subjects had increased plasma and VLDL cholesterol, plasma and VLDL triglycerides, and VLDL and intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) apoB concentrations (P &lt; 0.05). These abnormalities were chiefly a consequence of decreased VLDL and IDL apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR). Compared with hyperlipidemic E3/E2 subjects, type III hyperlipidemic E2/E2 subjects had increased IDL apoB concentration and decreased conversion of IDL to LDL particles (P &lt; 0.05). In a pooled analysis, VLDL cholesterol was positively associated with VLDL and IDL apoB concentrations and the proportion of VLDL apoB in the slowly turning over VLDL pool, and was negatively associated with VLDL apoB FCR after adjusting for subject group. VLDL triglyceride was positively associated with VLDL apoB concentration and VLDL and IDL apoB production rates after adjusting for subject group. A defective apoE contributes to altered lipoprotein metabolism but is not sufficient to cause overt hyperlipidemia. Additional genetic mutations and environmental factors, including insulin resistance and obesity, may contribute to the development of type III hyperlipidemia.
