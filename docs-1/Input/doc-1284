Genes for adiponectin and resistin are candidate genes of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) 45T&gt;G and 276G&gt;T of the adiponectin gene and 62G&gt;A and -180C&gt;G of the resistin gene in patients with obesity (OB), anorexia nervosa (AN) and in control healthy normal-weight women (NW) and to study the influence of particular genotypes on serum concentrations of these hormones and on insulin sensitivity. Serum adiponectin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), insulin, cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood glucose levels were measured in 77 patients with OB, 28 with AN and 38 NW. DNA analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction with restriction analysis of PCR product. The presence of SNP ADP+276 G&gt;T allele was accompanied by higher cholesterol levels in AN patients, higher adiponectin concentrations in OB patients and lower HbA1c levels in NW. SNP of the resistin gene 62G&gt;A was associated with lower HbA1c in NW and higher cholesterol concentrations in OB group. The carriers of the minor G allele in the position -180 of the resistin gene within AN group had significantly higher BMI relative to non-carriers. We conclude that polymorphisms in adiponectin and resistin genes can contribute to metabolic phenotype of patients with obesity and anorexia nervosa.
