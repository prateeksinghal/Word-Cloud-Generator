Essential hypertension is a complex disease influenced by different genetic and environmental factors. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is implicated in blood pressure regulation. Angiotensinogen (AGT) is the precursor of the biologically active angiotensin II (Ang II). Initial studies on hypertensive siblings and case-control studies indicated the important role of the angiotensinogen gene (AGT) for the predisposition to essential hypertension, preeclampsia and obesity-related hypertension. Recently, different AGT polymorphisms had been identified and analyzed in case-control studies. The aim of present studies is the analysis of potentially functional AGT variants (C-532T, G-6A), which might be responsible for the regulation of gene expression and therefore AGT generation. The A-6 allele is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the T235 allele and is associated with higher AGT expression in vitro. Segregation linkage analysis demonstrated that the C-532T polymorphism influences plasma AGT variability more significantly than the G-6A variant. Since the C-532T polymorphism is located within a AP-2 consensus element, functional promoter analyses are required. The understanding of the molecular basis of RAS in essential hypertension may provide us with new and more specific pharmacological agents and perhaps the ability to individualize antihypertensive treatment.
