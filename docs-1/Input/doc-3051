This paper reviews evidence supporting the notion that genetic factors may have an influence on the determination of body fat distribution, particularly emphasizing the genetic susceptibility of visceral adipose tissue (AT) accumulation. The potential contribution of genetic susceptibility to the development of metabolic alterations in visceral obese individuals will also be reviewed. The contribution of genetic factors to the variation in body fat distribution is supported by studies in which racial differences in body fat distribution were reported. These ethnic differences suggest that body fat distribution may be influenced by some components of the genetic background which are shared among individuals of a given race. Furthermore, the familial aggregation and the resemblance between monozygotic twins that have been observed for anthropometric measurements of body fat distribution and for visceral AT accumulation measured by computed tomography, also suggest that genetic factors are involved in the determination of body fat distribution. Genetic susceptibility may also influence the relationship between visceral AT accumulation and the development of metabolic alterations. In this regard, it has been reported that the polymorphism of some genes (for example, the apolipoprotein (apo) E, apo B100 and lipoprotein lipase genes) is altering the relationship between visceral obesity and plasma lipoprotein-lipid levels. In conclusion, results presented in this paper suggest that genetic factors seem to have a significant influence on the propensity to accumulate AT in the visceral depot and that genetic factors also seem to affect the associations commonly reported between visceral obesity and the development of metabolic alterations.
