Peroxisome proliferation is a cellular response to many chemical compounds affects including natural and modified fatty acids, phthalate and adipate ester plasticizers, leukotriene antagonists, acetylsalicylic acid and certain pathophysiological conditions including dramatic change of cellular morphology and enzymatic activity. Peroxisome proliferation phenomenon is seen primarily in liver and kidney. Hormones and nutritional factor can regulate peroxisome proliferation response. Sustained peroxisome proliferation can lead to hepatocarcinogenesis. The three types of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, termed PPAR alpha, PPAR beta, and PPAR gamma, expressed in specific tissue, are consisted of a specific a nuclear receptor superfamily. After more than 10 years world wide research, the function of PPAR is clarified, as PPAR gamma, the master of thrifty genes, controls the expression of genes relative to adipogenesis, diabetes mellitus and obesity. The receptor is involved in transcriptional control of numerous cellular processes including cell cycle control, inflammation, immunoregulation and carcinogenesis.
