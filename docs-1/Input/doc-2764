Genetic hemochromatosis (GH) is associated with two mutations of the HFE gene (Cys282Tyr and His63Asp). Heterozygosity for GH is associated with a mild increase in iron metabolism parameters, and increased iron stores are associated with abnormal glucose tolerance and decreased insulin sensitivity in the general population. We have previously shown that the frequency of the two HFE mutations is not increased in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, to assess whether the presence of HFE mutations modulates the clinical presentation of type 2 diabetes, we studied the clinical characteristics and iron metabolism indexes according to the presence of the two mutations in 266 patients with type 2 diabetes. The Cys282Tyr mutation and the His63Asp mutation were present in 9. 8% and 26% of the patients, respectively. Serum iron, transferrin saturation and ferritin concentrations were significantly increased in patients expressing either HFE mutations, compared to those without any mutation. There was no difference in the clinical characteristics in the two groups except that obesity was significantly less frequent in the patients with at least one mutation than in those without any mutation (27.6% vs 42.8%, p=0.02). This finding suggests that, in the absence of obesity, HFE mutations, through the insulin resistance associated with the increase in iron stores, may contribute to the onset of type 2 diabetes.
