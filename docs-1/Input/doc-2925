The etiology of cardiovascular diseases is known to be multi-factorial. Some forms of cardiovascular disease are influenced by unclear genetic factors but are predominantly affected by factors such as diet, obesity, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia. Some are caused by specific gene defects, with environmental factors playing a precipitating role. Others result from complex gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. Advances in knowledge of the molecular genetics of lipidaemic and vascular disorders have identified gene aberrations that are associated with cardiovascular disease. Techniques in molecular biology have been applied for rapid and reliable detection of specific gene defects to provide unequivocal diagnosis beneficial for appropriate drug therapy and genetic counseling. Pre-symptomatic diagnosis is possible and carriers can be advised on effective preventive measures. However, prior to the provision of a molecular diagnostic service, all gene alterations associated with cardiovascular disease have to be identified and their prevalence established in a population. The number of mutations in so many causative genes is enormous. While more cost-effective laboratory methodologies will be developed in the future, it is also anticipated that more mutations with direct or indirect effects on cardiovascular disease will be discovered in different populations.
