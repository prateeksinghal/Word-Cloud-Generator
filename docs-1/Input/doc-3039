The biological role of the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) in humans is not yet elucidated. This cellular receptor binds apolipoprotein E (apoE)-containing lipoparticles and is mainly expressed in peripheral tissues. The VLDL-R gene contains a polymorphic triplet (CGG) repeat located 19 bp upstream of the initiation codon. We explored the allelic distribution of this repeat in 1384 subjects of European Caucasian origin, 609 of them surviving a myocardial infarction. Six alleles corresponding to 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 repeats were detected in this population. The alleles 5, 8, and 9 were the most frequent, with frequencies of 0.413, 0.275, and 0.292, respectively. No association was found between the VLDL-R polymorphism and myocardial infarction. In controls without lipid lowering treatment, a statistically significant interaction between VLDL-R genotype and apoE phenotype was found for plasma triglycerides (P &lt; .04), suggesting a gene-gene interaction. There was also a main effect of the VLDL-R polymorphism on LpE:B and LpA-I. The VLDL-R 9 allele was associated with lower levels of plasma LpE:B (P &lt; .05) and higher concentrations of plasma LpA-I (P &lt; .01) than the other alleles. These results suggest that VLDL-R has a modest influence on circulating lipoproteins in humans.
