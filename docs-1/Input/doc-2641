Obesity is a complex disease resulting from the interaction between a variety of genetic and environmental factors. Research conducted over the past 20 years in the field of genetic epidemiology has contributed to increase our understanding of the genetic basis of obesity. It is now clearly established that overweight and obesity aggregate in families. Studies have shown that the prevalence of obesity is 2 to 8 times higher in families of obese individuals than in the population at large and that the familial risk increases with the severity of obesity. The heritability of the various obesity phenotypes varies considerably depending on the phenotype under study, the nature of familial data and the methods used to compute heritability estimates. Heritability estimates tend to be highest when derived from twin studies (50% à 80%) while they are the lowest when derived from adoption studies (10% à 30%). Several studies have reported the presence of major gene effects for body mass index, body fat and abdominal visceral fat. Finally, there is increasing evidence that shared genetic factors could play a role in determining the covariation between obesity and its major co-morbidities, including blood pressure, insulin resistance, diabetes and dyslipidemia. This genetic covariation is however moderate and accounts for a smaller percentage of the variance compared to the genetic effects reported for each of the phenotypes studied independently.
