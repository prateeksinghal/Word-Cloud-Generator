Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic growth factor that has been shown to play a significant role in neovascularization during inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques, formation of collateral vessels to an area of ischemic myocardium and neovascularization at the edges of a myocardial infarction during its repair. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) has important role in immune cell chemotaxis, formation of endothelial cell adhesion molecules and has numerous anti-inflammatory effects which prevent the complications of atherosclerosis, the primary cause of coronary heart disease (CHD). In this study, we have analyzed the effect of 1154 A/G polymorphism of VEGF and 70 bp VNTR polymorphism of intron 3 in IL-4 genes in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients (n = 300) and their age matched controls (n = 300). To analyze polymorphic alleles, ARMS-PCR and RFLP techniques were used. Multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out with statistical software. GG genotype was associated with a decreased risk of development of CHD (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12-0.38, P &lt; 0.001). However, A allele showed an increased risk whereas G allele decreased the risk of CHD with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic mental stress and positive familial history of myocardial infarction (MI)/CHD. GG genotype was found to have protective effect with alcohol intake (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.82, P &lt; 0.01) and central obesity (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04-0.56, P &lt; 0.001). GG genotype of VEGF has also shown significant association with IL-4 (P2P2 and P1P2) genotypes.
