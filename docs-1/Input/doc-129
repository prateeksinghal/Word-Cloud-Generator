Supplementation with a mixture of trans-10, cis-12 (t10,c12) and cis-9, trans-11 (c9,t11) isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), or t10,c12 CLA alone, reduces body weight and fat deposition in animals and some humans. However, these anti-obesity actions of t10,c12 CLA are routinely accompanied by increased markers of inflammation and insulin resistance. Thus, we examined the extent to which blocking c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling using the JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated markers of inflammation and insulin resistance in primary human adipocytes treated with t10,c12 CLA. SP600125 attenuated t10,c12 CLA-mediated phosphorylation of cJun and increased protein levels of activating transcription factor (ATF) 3, two downstream targets of JNK. SP600125 attenuated t10,c12 CLA-mediated induction of inflammatory genes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, ATF3, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and cyclooxygenase-2. Consistent with these data, SP600125 prevented t10,c12 CLA-mediated secretion of IL-8, IL-6, and MCP-1. SP600125 prevented t10,c12 CLA suppression of lipogenic genes including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element binding protein, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Additionally, SP600125 blocked t10,c12 CLA-mediated induction of suppressor of cytokine synthesis-3 and suppression of adiponectin and insulin-dependent glucose transporter 4 mRNA levels. Collectively, these data suggest that JNK signaling plays an important role in t10,c12 CLA-mediated regulation of inflammatory and lipogenic gene expression in primary cultures of human adipocytes.
