Recently, it has been suggested that insulin resistance is a better predictor of metabolic syndrome than obesity. Numerous studies have been conducted to identify insulin resistance susceptibility genes in various model systems. This review focuses on recent findings in microarray analyses, which have indicated that (i) in the liver, genes involved in lipid synthesis and gluconeogenesis are increased in an animal model of insulin resistance that leads into liver steatosis and hyperglycemia; (ii) in adipose tissues, genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and adipogenesis are down-regulated both in insulin-resistant humans and in animals; and (iii) in muscle, overall gene expression, including genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and biosynthesis, is either decreased or unresponsive compared to that of insulin-sensitive control human subjects or animals. Considering the multifaceted effects of insulin resistance in various tissues, aiming at multi-targets rather than a single target will be a more promising strategy for the prevention or treatment of insulin resistance.
