Triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses were measured in 222 pairs of like-sex twins (78 monozygotic and 144 dizygotic) aged 3-15 years. Log transformations of the measurements were standardized for age and sex and the results used to estimate heritability--that is, the proportion of total variation determined by genetic factors. The overall contribution of non-genetic familial effects was small. There were appreciable differences in heritability between limb and trunk fat and between the sexes and at different ages. Over the age of 10 heritability was high for both sites in boys and girls. In younger children environmental factors contributed more to the variation.
