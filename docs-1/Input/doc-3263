Obesity is a highly prevalent disease that carries enormous human and economic costs in western nations. The complexity and diversity of the paths leading to an overweight or an obesity status are enormous. The etiology, causes, associated morbidity, treatment, benefits versus risks of weight loss, prevention, and other aspects of obesity are all highly complex and intimately associated with other diseases, the prevalence of which is augmented by our present way of life. This article gives a brief overview of the current status of knowledge of the genetic basis of human obesity from a genetic epidemiology, experimental genetic and molecular biology perspective. It appears likely that the susceptibility to obesity depends, to a large extent, on several autosomal genes.
