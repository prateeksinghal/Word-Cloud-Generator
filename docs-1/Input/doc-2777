Insulin resistance predisposes to the development of a cluster of abnormalities including glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, which may relate to the excess intra-abdominal fat deposits. The cluster of abnormalities increases a risk of atherosclerosis and comprises multiple risk factor syndrome (MRFS). Though many suspectable candidate genes of MRFS was analyzed, there is no compelling candidate gene by itself for MRFS. Simultaneous existence of polygenic and environmental factors may induce MRFS resulting in atherosclerosis.
