We used mouse genetics to model how polygenic thresholds for the transition from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to NIDDM are reached. NON/Lt and NZO/Hl are inbred mouse strains selected for IGT and polygenic obesity, respectively. Their F1 male progeny consistently developed NIDDM. Genetic analysis of F2 males from both cross directions identified an NON-derived diabetogenic locus, Nidd 1, on chromosome (Chr) 4 near the leptin receptor. This locus was associated with reduced plasma insulin, increased non-fasted blood glucose, and lower body weight. Another NON-derived diabetogenic locus on Chr 18 (Nidd2) that controls blood glucose was identified. An NZO-derived diabetogenic region on Chr 11 (Nidd3), possibly comprising two separate loci, reduced ability to sustain elevated plasma insulin and significantly reduced weight gain over time. Thus, the diabetogenic synergism between genetic loci from strains separately exhibiting subthreshold defects perturbing glucose homeostasis underscores the likely complexity of the inheritance of obesity-associated forms of NIDDM in humans.
