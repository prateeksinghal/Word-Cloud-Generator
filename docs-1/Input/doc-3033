Leptin is an adipocyte-derived blood-borne satiety factor that is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. We have recently demonstrated nonadipose tissue production of leptin; leptin is synthesized in and secreted from placental trophoblasts (Nature Med. 3: 1029-1033, 1997). To understand the transcriptional regulation of the human leptin gene in placental trophoblasts, we examined the promoter activity of various lengths of the human leptin 5'-flanking sequences in BeWo cells, a human trophoblastic cell line. The 2080-bp human leptin gene promoter region (-2080 to +108) showed a high-level transcription activity in BeWo cells. When DNA sequences between -1885 and -1830 were deleted, the promoter activity was reduced dramatically in BeWo cells. No significant changes in the promoter activity were noted when tested in primary cultures of rat mature adipocytes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the presence of nuclear protein(s) binding to the sequences in BeWo cells but not in isolated rat mature adipocytes. The present study provides new insight into the trophoblast-specific transcription of the human leptin gene.
