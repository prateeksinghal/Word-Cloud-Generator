Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) is the rate limiting enzyme catalyzing the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids preferentially from palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA forming respectively palmitoleyl-CoA and oleyl-CoA. These monounsaturated fatty acids are the key components of triglycerides and membrane phospholipids. Studying the regulation of SCD1 is of particular interest since alterations in phospholipids composition have been implicated in a variety of diseases including cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, oleic acid, the main product of SCD1 reaction, is the predominant fatty acid of human adipose tissue triacylglycerols, associating SCD1 with the development of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. In light of the key role of SCD1 in general metabolism, it is not surprising to observe a very tight and complex regulation of SCD1 gene expression in response to various parameters including hormonal and nutrient factors. In this review we analyze the anatomy and index the transcription factors that have been characterized to bind the SCD1 promoter. Then we present the current knowledge on how hormones regulate SCD1 expression with a particular interest on the role of insulin and leptin. We also describe how nutrients especially polyunsaturated fatty acids and carbohydrates modulate SCD1 gene expression.
