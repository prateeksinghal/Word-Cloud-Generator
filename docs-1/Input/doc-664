Prohormone convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) genetic polymorphisms have recently been associated with obesity in European populations. This study aimed to examine whether common PCSK1 genetic variation is associated with obesity and related metabolic phenotypes in the Chinese population. We genotyped nine common tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNP) of the PCSK1 gene in 1,094 subjects of Chinese origin from the Stanford Asia-Pacific Program for Hypertension and Insulin Resistance (SAPPHIRe) family study. One SNP in the PCSK1 gene (rs155971) were nominally associated with risk of obesity in the SAPPHIRe cohort (P = 0.01). A common protective haplotype was associated with reduced risk of obesity (23.79% vs. 32.89%, P = 0.01) and smaller waist circumference (81.71 +/- 10.22 vs. 84.75 +/- 10.48 cm, P = 0.02). Another common haplotype was significantly associated with increased risk of obesity (37.07% vs. 23.84%, P = 0.005). The global P value for haplotype association with obesity was 0.02. We also identified a suggestive association of another PCSK1 SNP (rs3811951) with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)), triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.05, 0.003, 0.001, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively). These data indicate common PCSK1 genetic variants are associated with obesity in the Chinese population.
