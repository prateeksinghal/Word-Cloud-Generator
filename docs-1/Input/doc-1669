Identification of genetic polymorphisms as risk factors for complex diseases affecting older people can be relevant for their prevention, diagnosis and management. The -1131T--&gt;C polymorphism of the apolipoprotein A-V gene (APO A-V) is tightly linked to lipid metabolism and has been associated with increased triglyceride levels and familial dyslipidemia. The aims of this study were to analyze the allele and genotype frequencies of this polymorphism in a Brazilian elderly population and to investigate any association between the polymorphism and major morbidities affecting elderly people. This polymorphism was investigated in 371 individuals, aged 66-97 years, in a Brazilian Elderly Longitudinal Population Study. Major morbidities investigated were: cerebrovascular diseases (CVD); myocardial infarction (MI); type 2 diabetes; hypertension; obesity; dementia; depression; and neoplasia. DNA was isolated and amplified by PCR and its products were digested with restriction enzyme Tru1I. T and C allele frequencies were 0.842 and 0.158, respectively. Our population showed allele frequencies that were similar to European and Afro-American and different from Asiatic populations. Genotype distributions were not within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium only for the obesity subject sample. On the other hand, a significant association between the C allele and obesity in the presence of CVDxdepression interaction was observed. Logistic analysis showed no association of the polymorphism with each morbidity group. Therefore, the C allele in elderly Brazilian subjects may represent a risk factor for these morbidity interactions, which may lead to better comprehension of their pathophysiology.
