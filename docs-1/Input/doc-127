Obesity is an inflammatory condition that is also associated with increased extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression. However, a direct link between adipose tissue inflammation and ECM gene expression has not been established. Therefore, we determined the effect of chronic inflammation induced by obesity and acute inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge on ECM genes including biglycan (BGN), collagen 1A1 (COL1A1) and COL6A1, major ECM genes in adipose tissue. Male C57BL/6J mice fed either a control diet (10% fat calories) or a high-fat diet (HFD) (60% fat calories) for 6 weeks were treated with LPS or saline 24 h before sacrifice. Expression of ECM genes in the epididymal (EWAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SWAT) was determined by RT-PCR and protein abundance by Western blotting. Human SWAT from lean and obese subjects was also analyzed. Increased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of ECM genes BGN and COL1A1 was observed in the mouse EWAT after HFD (P&lt;.05). However, reduced amount of COL1A1 protein was observed in EWAT of mice on HFD and in SWAT from obese human subjects. Acute inflammation induced BGN mRNA in EWAT, enhanced the gene expression of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) 3 and 9. Acute inflammation also resulted in higher MMP9 gelatinolytic activity; however, this showed no association with COL1A1 protein abundance. Higher MMP2 expression in mice on HFD suggests its involvement in the reduction of COL1A1 protein abundance with HFD. Elevated MMP9 gelatinolytic activity in SWAT from obese humans indicates a prominent role for MMP9 in SWAT COL1A1 protein turnover in humans.
