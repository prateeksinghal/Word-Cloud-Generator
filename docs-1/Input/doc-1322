It has been estimated that up to 1 in 10 adults has at least one adrenocortical nodule up to 1 cm on autopsy; these benign tumors may contribute to metabolic syndrome, hypertension, obesity and abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that can be linked to other serious disorders such as osteoporosis, depression and late-onset diabetes mellitus. In addition, up to 1 in 1500 of these adrenal &quot;incidentalomas&quot; may hide a carcinoma, which, if diagnosed late or left untreated, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Consistent with the theme of this symposium, in the present report, we review the efforts undertaken at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the last quarter century to unravel the complex clinical genetics and molecular mechanisms involved in adrenal tumorigenesis. We first proposed that adrenocortical tumors form in a molecular sequence of events similar to that in other organs: as the pathology of the tumor increases towards malignancy, genetic changes accumulate. For example, known genetic associations, like TP53 gene changes, occur during the latest stages of adrenocortical tumorigenesis. At the NIH, significant progress has been made in the understanding of the genetics of primary pigmented adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) and other forms of bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasias. This recently led to the identification of phosphodiesterase 11A ( PDE11A) mutations as a low-penetrance predisposing factor to adrenocortical hyperplasias of both the pigmented and non-pigmented variants.
