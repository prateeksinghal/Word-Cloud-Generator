Polymorphisms in a number of candidate genes have been reported to be associated with obesity. We have determined the incidence of the following polymorphisms in the following candidate genes in a group of 388 morbid obese patients (mean body mass index (BMI) 52+/-8.01) who underwent gastric banding surgery: lipoprotein lipase (LpL) t-93 g and N291S; peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma (PPARgamma), P12A, P115Q and c1431t; peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha (PPARalpha) L162V; beta-adrenergic receptor 2 (beta-AR 2), Q27E; beta-adrenergic receptor 3 (beta-AR 3) W64R; uncoupling protein 1 (ucp-1), a-3826g, ucp-2, 45 bp insertion. Only for the ucp2 polymorphism did we find a statistically significant association with obesity. The beta-AR 3 W64R and ucp-1 a-3826g polymorphisms influenced the rate of the development of obesity and may act synergistically.
