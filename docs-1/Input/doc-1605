Over the past years RNA interference (RNAi) has exploded as a new approach to manipulate gene expression in mammalian systems. More recently, RNAi has acquired interest as a potential therapeutic strategy. This review focuses on the potential therapeutic use of RNAi for metabolic diseases, the current understanding of RNAi biology, and how RNAi has been utilized to study the role of different genes in the pathogenesis of diabetes and obesity. Also reviewed are the in vivo proof-of-principle experiments that provide the preclinical justification for the development of RNAi-based therapeutics for diabetes and the key challenges that currently limit its application in the clinical setting.
