KRAS-induced actin-interacting protein (KRAP) was originally identified as one of the genes deregulated in colorectal cancer. KRAP encodes a cytoplasmic protein associated with filamentous-actin (F-actin), and the amino acid sequences are highly conserved among KRAP orthologues from fish to mammalian species. We demonstrated that KRAP-deficient mice show altered whole-body energy metabolism and resistance to diet-induced obesity and diabetes. Although the precise mechanisms underlying the metabolic phenotypes in the KRAP-deficient mice remain unclear, KRAP is considered to be a target for metabolism-related diseases. Furthermore, several groups have reported that KRAP is a cancer-associated gene. Further studies on the molecular functions of KRAP in physiological tissues could provide a better understanding of various diseases, and opportunities for intervention in various human diseases. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of KRAP and the roles that it plays in a variety of diseases.
