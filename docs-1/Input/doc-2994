We have investigated the W64R (Trp64Arg) mutation in the beta-3-adrenergic receptor in 2270 healthy British males aged 50-61 y. The frequency of the rare R allele was 0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06-0.08). The men showed an absence of association between W64R genotype and weight or height, both in the whole sample and in each quintile of the body mass index (BMI), and there was no association with tendency to gain weight. The W64R heterozygous state appears not to be a major contributing factor to obesity in the general population.
