The Trp 64 Arg mutation in the beta 3-adrenergic receptor (beta 3AR) gene was investigated in 350 Japanese subjects. This mutation was not associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). In 191 subjects without NIDDM, body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in subjects homozygous for this mutation than in those homozygous for the normal allele (24.7 +/- 1.4 vs 22.1 +/- 0.2 kg/m2, p = 0.009). Moreover, the frequency of the mutant allele in obese subjects (BMI &gt; 26.4) was significantly higher than that in non-obese subjects (BMI &lt; 22) (0.37 vs 0.15, p = 0.009). The presence of this mutation was also accompanied by significantly higher fasting (p = 0.000) and 2 hrs (p = 0.018) serum insulin levels during an oral glucose tolerance test. The beta 3AR may be one of the loci contributing to obesity and hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance in Japanese subjects.
