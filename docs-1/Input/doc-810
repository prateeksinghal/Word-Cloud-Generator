Leptin is overexpressed in human breast tumors and is produced by breast cancer cells in response to obesity-related stimuli. The leptin promoter polymorphism Lep-2548G/A can be associated with increased leptin secretion by adipocytes and elevated cancer risk. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the link between Lep-2548G/A and breast cancer have never been addressed. Lep-2548G/A is proximal to a binding site for the transcriptional factor Sp1. Furthermore nucleolin, a transcriptional repressor, can bind Sp1 or its consensus site. Consequently, we focused on the impact of Lep-2548G/A on Sp1- and nucleolin-dependent leptin transcription in breast cancer cells. The Lep-2548G/A was identified in a homozygous conformation in BT-474 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells, in a heterozygous conformation in MDA-MB-231 cells, and a wild-type Lep-2548G/G sequence was present in MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells. The occurrence of Lep-2548A/A and Lep-2548G/A coincided with high and intermediate leptin mRNA expression, respectively, while cells containing Lep-2548G/G expressed low leptin mRNA levels. We demonstrated that the existence of Lep-2548G/A improved efficient recruitment of Sp1 to DNA under insulin treatment, while Sp1 loading on DNA containing Lep-2548G/G was not insulin-dependent. In contrast, nucleolin binding to Lep-2548G/A was downregulated in response to insulin, while it was not regulated on Lep-2548G/G. The presence of Lep-2548G/A was studied in breast cancer epithelial cells by IHC and LCM. Interestingly, all 14 tumors expressing high leptin levels contained Lep-2548A/A. In conclusion, the occurrence of Lep-2548G/A can enhance leptin expression in breast cancer cells via Sp1- and nucleolin-dependent mechanisms and possibly contribute to intratumoral leptin overexpression.
