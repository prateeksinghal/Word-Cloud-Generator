People with a predominance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles appear to be at increased risk for coronary disease, independent of LDL cholesterol levels. The Trp64Arg variant of the beta3-adrenergic receptor gene is reported to be associated with abdominal obesity and resistance to insulin, and as a consequence, this variant may be a genetic factor in the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, we investigated whether the beta3-adrenergic receptor polymorphism contributes to the distribution of LDL particle size in 136 Japanese subjects, aged 33 to 59 years, who visited for a routine annual checkup. None of these subjects were taking any medication. The diameter of LDL particles was determined at their peak size using nondenaturing 2% to 16% polyacrylamide gradient gels using fresh plasma samples. The genotype frequencies were: Trp/Trp, 71.3%; Try/Arg, 22.1%; and Arg/Arg, 6.6%, with allele frequencies of 0.82 for Trp64 and 0.18 for Arg64. The subjects with the Arg/Arg genotype had significantly higher levels of fasting plasma insulin and triglycerides and an insulin resistance index of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-R), and significantly smaller LDL particle size than did the subjects with the Trp/Trp genotype. After adjusting for fasting insulin, body mass index (BMI), and HOMA-R index, there was no longer an observed difference in LDL particle size. The number of the Arg64 allele in individuals was significantly related with fasting insulin, BMI, triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting glucose, and it was inversely related with LDL particle size. After adjusting for triglyceride, fasting insulin levels, and HOMA-R index, LDL particle size was no longer inversely correlated with the Arg allele. These findings suggest that the Trp64Arg variant in the beta3-adrenergic receptor gene may be associated with reducing LDL particle size, probably due to insulin resistance.
