Complex endocrinopathies, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome and osteoporosis belong to the most common diseases but their pathogenesis is still not fully explained. Environmental fadors along with genetic factors contribute to their occurrence and development. The study of genetic background is based on different strategies, mostly on linkage analysis and candidate gene approach. The common forms of these endocrinopathies do not seem to be the result of a defect of one or several major genes but the search for complex gene-gene, gene-environment interactions is needed. The article gives a short review of the recent knowledge together with our own experience in the field of study of the genetic background of polygenic diseases.
