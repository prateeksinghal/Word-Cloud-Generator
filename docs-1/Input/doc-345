The health implications of physical inactivity, including its integral role in promoting obesity, are well known and have been well documented. Physical activity is a multifactorial behavior with various factors playing a role in determining individual physical activity levels. Research using both human and animal models in the past several years has clearly indicated that genetics is associated with physical activity. Furthermore, researchers have identified several significant and suggestive genomic quantitative trait loci associated with physical activity. To date, the identities of the causal genes underlying physical activity regulation are unclear, with few strong candidate genes. The current research provides a foundation from which future confirmatory research can be launched as well as determination of the mechanisms through which the genetic factors act. The application of this knowledge could significantly augment the information available for physical activity behavior change interventions resulting in more efficient programs for those predisposed to be inactive.
