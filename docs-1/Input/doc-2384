We studied a previously reported association between the IGF2 gene's ApaI polymorphism and obesity in 500 healthy men and women (19-90 y). We hypothesized that individuals homozygous for the IGF2 A allele (A/A) would exhibit lower body mass, BMI and DEXA-measured fat mass compared to G/G homozygotes. Subjects were categorized as exhibiting the G/G (n = 241), G/A (n = 197) or A/A (n = 62) genotype. Contrary to our hypothesis, no difference was observed in body mass, body mass index (BMI) or fat mass between the G/G and A/A genotype groups in the entire cohort. Surprisingly, Caucasian A/A individuals (n = 427) exhibited significantly higher fat mass compared to Caucasian G/G individuals (P &lt; 0.05). In summary, individuals homozygous for the IGF2 G allele do not exhibit higher body mass, BMI or fat mass compared to A/A individuals; however, Caucasians with the A/A genotype exhibit higher fat mass than G/G individuals.
