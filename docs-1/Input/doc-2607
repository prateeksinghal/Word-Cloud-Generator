Decreased function of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) was reported to cause late-onset obesity and insulin resistance in rodents. Thus mutations in the MC4R gene drew strong attention as a possible cause of obesity and diabetes. We screened for mutations in the MC4R gene in extremely obese [body mass index (BMI) &gt; or = 35 kg/m2] Japanese with diabetes by direct sequencing. A heterozygous mutation (V103I) was detected in one case (2.0 %), however the frequency was not significantly different from that in non-obese (BMI &lt; or = 24 kg/m2) and non-diabetic subjects (2.7 %). No other mutations were detected. These results suggest that mutations including V103I in the MC4R gene are not a major cause of obesity or diabetes in Japanese.
