The risk for developing obesity has a significant genetic component. Several quantitative trait loci and candidate genes have been identified using current methodological approaches however the information gained thus far is insufficient to adequately explain the genetics underlying human obesity. The completion of a draft of the human genome sequence, the potential benefit of single nucleotide polymorphisms association studies for identifying risk conferring alleles, and developing functional genomics technologies promise to accelerate obesity gene discovery. These advances, used with current evaluative tools (murine molecular genetic techniques), may increase our understanding of human obesity, and ultimately provide better approaches to diagnosis and treatment.
