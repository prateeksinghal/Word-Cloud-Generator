The promise of nutrigenomics is of personalized nutrition that will lead to optimization or maintenance of good health and/or prevention of the development of chronic diseases. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a leading health problem throughout the world. Adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet, regulation of carbohydrate intake, and regular exercise may be desirable. Four key genes were originally identified: KCNJ11, potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11 gene; PPAR-gamma, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma; TCF2, transcription factor 2, hepatic; WFS1, Wolfram syndrome 1. However, genome-wide association studies are accelerating our knowledge of the genetics of complex diseases, and have identified seven other key genes in T2DM: CDKAL1, CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein-like 1; CDKN2, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; FTO, fat mass and obesity associated; HHEX, haematopoietically expressed homeobox; IDE, insulin-degrading enzyme; IGF2BP2, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2; SLC30A8, solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter), member 8; TCF7L2, transcription factor 7-like 2 (T-cell specific, HMG-box). Gene-nutrient or gene-environment interactions may be important. For example, the PPAR-gamma variant genotype is responsive to different types and levels of lipids, while the effect of the FTO variant can be partly overcome by exercise. Several of these genes act through their effect on the gastrointestinal tract. There are analytical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional datasets relating genes, nutrients, and other variables to their influence on health and disease processes. An even greater challenge may be in implementing population level changes in diet and behavior to fully exploit the potential of this field.
