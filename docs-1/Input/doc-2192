Insulin resistance syndrome (also called syndrome X) includes obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia and is a complex phenotype of metabolic abnormalities. The disorder poses a major public health problem by predisposing individuals to coronary heart disease and stroke, the leading causes of mortality in Western countries. Given that hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity exhibit a substantial heritable component, it is postulated that certain genes may predispose some individuals to this cluster of cardiovascular risk factors. Emerging data suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), including alpha, gamma, and delta, are important determinants that may provide a functional link between obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. It has been well documented that hypolipidemic fibrates and antidiabetic thiazolidinediones are synthetic ligands for PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma, respectively. In addition, PPAR natural ligands, such as leukotriene B4 for PPAR alpha, 15-deoxy-delta 12,14-prostaglandin J2 for PPAR gamma, and prostacyclin for PPAR delta, are known to be eicosanoids and fatty acids. Studies have documented that PPARs are present in all critical vascular cells: endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and monocyte-macrophages. These observations suggest that PPARs not only control lipid metabolism but also regulate vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. In this review, we present structure and tissue distribution of PPAR nuclear receptors, discuss the mechanisms of action and regulation, and summarize the rapid progress made in this area of study and its impact on the cardiovascular system.
