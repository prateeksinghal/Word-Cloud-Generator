Both genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Most of the genetic studies on common obesity are confined to the links between a given gene polymorphism or gene loci and different phenotypes of obesity or anthropometric measures. Some studies indicate that genetic factors modify the weight reduction response to energy restriction or weight gain in the long-term. Only a few studies have focused on gene-diet interaction in the development of type 2 diabetes. The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study shows (DPS) that the success of a lifestyle intervention depends also on the polymorphisms of those genes, which are suggested to play a role in energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, insulin resistance or insulin secretion. This review deals with selected genes examined so far in the DPS.
