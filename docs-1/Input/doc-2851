The Trp64Arg mutation of the beta3-adrenergic receptor (beta3AR) gene and A to G polymorphism of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) gene are reported to be associated with weight gain, and both have been shown to have an additive effect on weight gain in Caucasians. Racial differences have also been noted in the beta3AR mutation; however, the effect of UCP1 polymorphism on body weight is not obvious in the Japanese. Thus, we investigated the association of genetic variations in beta3AR and UCP1 genes and the additive effects of these two genes in 214 Japanese men. The frequency of the Trp64Arg allele was 0.19, and serum triglyceride was significantly higher in Arg64 homozygotes versus Trp64 homozygotes. The frequency of the G allele was 0.51, and the body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in subjects with the G allele (GG homozygotes and AG heterozygotes) versus those without it (AA homozygotes). The beta3AR mutation and UCP1 polymorphism were not found to have additive effects, and they were not related to glucose tolerance patterns and insulin resistance. Our results suggest that the beta3AR mutation is associated with hypertriglyceridemia and the UCP1 polymorphism may be a weak contributing factor to obesity in Japanese men.
