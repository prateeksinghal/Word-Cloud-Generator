Mutations of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) are associated with hyperphagia, obesity, and accelerated longitudinal growth in pig, mice and human. However, little is known about the functions of this gene in chicken. To map the MC4R gene in Chicken chromosome, we used a 6000 rads chicken-hamster radiation hybrid panel (ChikenRH6). PCR of samples from the ChikenRH6 revealed the location of the MC4R gene to be nearby markers MCW0062, BCL2 and OVY on chromosome 2q12. Five markers were placed into a single linkage group based on two-point analysis with a LOD score of greater than 5. At the same time, the MC4R gene was selected as marker to compare DNA sequence between chicken and human chromosome. The result shows there are the same homologous regions between chicken chromosome 2 (GGA2) and human chromosome 18 (HSA18), and we found that the genes BCL2 and obesity are located in the near regions of MC4R on human chromosome 18. So we can reduce that the chicken MC4R gene maybe there are the same functions with the human MC4R gene. Overall, this work reveals widespread chromosome rearrangements of MC4R between chicken and human genomes, and mappings the chicken MC4R gene on 2q12 by a RH panel.
