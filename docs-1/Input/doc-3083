Despite the influence of obesity in predisposing to many diseases, and evidence for high heritability, efforts to identify human genes with major effects on bodyweight have not yet been successful. In contrast, remarkable progress has been made in the identification and characterization of the genes mutated in five monogenic mouse models of obesity. These genes have led to new insights into the etiology of obesity and provide promising targets for therapeutic intervention.
