Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a unique lipid that elicits dramatic reductions in adiposity in several animal models when included at &lt; or = 1% of the diet. Despite a flurry of investigations, the precise mechanisms by which conjugated linoleic acid elicits its dramatic effects in adipose tissue and liver are still largely unknown. In vivo and in vitro analyses of physiological modifications imparted by conjugated linoleic acid on protein and gene expression suggest that conjugated linoleic acid exerts its de-lipidating effects by modulating energy expenditure, apoptosis, fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis, stromal vascular cell differentiation and lipogenesis. The purpose of this review shall be to examine the recent advances and insights into conjugated linoleic acid's effects on obesity and lipid metabolism, specifically focused on changes in gene expression and physiology of liver and adipose tissue.
