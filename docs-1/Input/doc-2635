Acrp30 is an abundantly expressed secretory protein exclusively synthesized in adipose tissue. Due to the dysregulation in various forms of obesity in humans and mice and its strong structural similarity to TNFalpha, it is currently under study as an important molecule involved in whole body energy homeostasis. Here we describe the sequence of mouse Acrp30 locus, define the intron/exon boundaries and map the gene to the telomere of mouse chromosome 16, syntenic to the human chromosomal locus 3q27. We demonstrate that alternative polyadenylation gives rise to two distinct mRNA species. We also show that Acrp30 expression is induced only at the late stages of mouse embryonic development. Finally, we have characterized the mouse Acrp30 promoter in tissue culture cells. We propose that Acrp30 promoter has the potential to drive strong adipocyte specific heterologous gene expression in transgenic mice.
