We examined distribution characteristics of the body mass index (BMI; weight/height; kg/m2) in a sample of 1128 male and 1372 female Pima Indians aged 15-65 years. We found that women had a higher mean and variance of BMI than men. From commingling analyses, we determined that the distribution of BMI could be accounted for either by a single skewed distribution or by a mixture of multiple normal components. These component distributions may be used to define provisional thresholds in selecting families for genetic studies. To ensure genetic segregation of obesity predisposing genes in Pima families will require that some members have BMIs &gt; or = 40 kg/m2.
