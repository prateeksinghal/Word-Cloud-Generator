Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a heterogeneous multisystemic disorder characterized primarily by five cardinal features of retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, hypogenitalism and mental retardation. To date, six distinct BBS loci that have been identified on different chromosomes. BBS4 gene is mapped to 15q22.2-23, which when mutated can cause BBS4. Its protein shows strong homology to O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase. Here we report a splice variant of BBS4, which is 2556 bp in length and has an open reading frame coding a predicted 527 amino-acids protein. RT-PCR shows that the cDNA is widely expressed while it has higher expression levels in pancreas, liver and prostate.
