Obesity is a common disorder with potentially serious negative implications on health and quality of life and a rising prevalence worldwide, warranting effective treatments. The disorder runs in families, and important knowledge is expected to follow the identification of human obesity genes. Although statistical analysis of inheritance of obesity in humans suggests a large genetic component in obesity, up to 80%, few actual obesity genes have been identified so far. However, a number of obesity causing genes have successfully been cloned from rodents with monogenic forms of obesity, and it is probable that new knowledge in the field of human obesity will result from these findings.
