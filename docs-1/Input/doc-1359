Hypertension is an increasing public health problem all over the world. Essential hypertension accounts for more than 90% of cases of hypertension. It is a complex genetic, environmental and demographic trait. New method in molecular biology has been proposed a number of candidate genes, but the linkage or association with hypertension has been problematic (lack of gene-gene and gene-environment interaction). It is well known that genetic influences are more important in younger hypertensives, because children are relatively free from the common environmental factors contributing to essential hypertension. The association studies compare genotype ferquencies of the candidate gene between patient groups and the controls, in pathways known to be involved in blood pressure regulation. This study examined three polymorphisms of these factors encoding genes (ET-1 G+5665T (Lys198Asn), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) T-786C promoter polymorphism and 27-bp repeat polymorphism in intron 4) in adolescents with juvenile essential and obesity-associated hypertension. Significant differences were found in the G/T genotype of the ET-1 polymorphism in the hypertensive and obese+hypertensive patients (body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30). A strong association was detected between the BMI and the polymorphism of the ET-1 gene. It seems that ET-1 gene polymorphism plays a role in the development of juvenile hypertension associated with obesity. Although no significant differences were seen in the case of the eNOS promoter polymorphism and the eNOS 4th intron 27-bp repeat polymorphism. It seems that eNOS may play a role, but this is not the main factor in the control of blood pressure; it is rather a fine regulator in this process. This study with adolescents facilitates an understanding of the genetic factors promoting juvenile hypertension and obesity.
