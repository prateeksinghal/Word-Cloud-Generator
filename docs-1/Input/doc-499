Although inflammation has been shown to play an important role in metabolic syndrome (MetS), the association between inflammatory marker gene polymorphisms and the risk of MetS has not been fully elucidated. This study was initiated to investigate the association between functional variants of inflammatory marker genes and the risk of MetS in Taiwanese adults. The sample population comprised 615 unrelated subjects, of which 22% had MetS. The single nucleotide polymorphisms rs5491 on the intercellular adhesive molecule 1 (ICAM1) gene and rs3091244 on C-reactive protein (CRP) were genotyped. The ICAM1 rs5491 polymorphism was significantly associated with the level of soluble intercellular adhesive molecule 1 (P &lt; .001). Both the ICAM1 rs5491 and the CRP rs3091244 were shown to have significant association with MetS after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and body mass index, but not after adjustment for levels of the respective serum marker. Independent associations between the combined ICAM1-CRP (rs5491 and rs3091244) genotypes and MetS were found by multivariate analysis (P = .005). In subgroup analysis, association of combined genotypes with insulin resistance and MetS mainly occurred in subjects with central obesity. In conclusion, inflammatory marker gene polymorphisms play an important role in modulating the risk of insulin resistance and MetS for subjects with central obesity. These findings will contribute toward a better understanding of the mechanism of association between inflammatory markers and the risk of developing atherosclerotic disease.
