We investigated the association between the rs9939609 (T&gt;A) polymorphism in the FTO (fat mass- and obesity-associated) gene and obesity- and type 2 diabetes mellitus-related phenotypes in the French Multinational MONItoring of Trends and Determinants in CArdiovascular Disease (MONICA) Study (n = 3367). In the study, TA or AA subjects had higher body mass index (BMI) (P = .017), waist circumference (P = .017), and hip (P = .01) circumference in an A allele dose-dependent manner. The A allele was also significantly associated with higher plasma insulin levels (P = .05), higher insulin resistance index (homeostasis model assessment) (P = .02), and higher systolic blood pressure (P = .003); but these associations disappeared after adjustment for BMI. In the study, 598 subjects were obese (BMI &gt;or=30 kg/m(2)); and 2769 subjects were not obese (BMI &lt;30 kg/m(2)). Subjects bearing the A allele of rs9939609 had a higher risk of obesity (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.29 [1.06-1.58], P = .01) compared with TT subjects. Moreover, the homozygous AA genotype of rs9939609 was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (odds ratio = 1.45 [1.05-1.99], P = .02, 283 subjects with and 2601 subjects without type 2 diabetes mellitus), independently of BMI. In conclusion, the role of the A allele of the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism on the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus was confirmed in the French MONICA Study.
