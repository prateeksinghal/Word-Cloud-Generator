OBJECTIVES AND JUSTIFICATION: To describe facilitated diffusion glucose transporters (GLUT) in humans, and particularly the regulation of GLUT4 expression since it is predominantly responsible for insulin-mediated glucose transport in muscle and adipose tissue, and plays a crucial role in whole-body glucose homeostasis. MAIN POINTS: Numerous studies have shown abnormal expression of GLUT4 in insulin responsive tissues in diabetes mellitus and other insulin resistant states. The recent development of transgenic mice that overexpress GLUT4 in muscle, adipose tissue, or both has also emphasized the importance of GLUT4 in glucose homeostasis. PERSPECTIVES AND PROJECTS: The studies performed in transgenic mice suggest that strategies to increase GLUT4 transporters in insulin responsive tissues may lead to new therapeutic possibilities to improve insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant states such as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Glucose transport is a crucial process in mammals, which needs specific transmembrane hexose transporters. Each transporter is important in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Advances in the knowledge of both the action and the regulation of the glucose transport system may provide new insights for the development of therapeutic interventions in diseases such as obesity or diabetes mellitus.
