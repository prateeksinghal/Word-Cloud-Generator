Heterotrimeric guanine-binding proteins (G proteins) transmit signals from the cell surface to intracellular signal cascades. The Î²3-subunit encoded by the gene GNB3 is widely expressed and, therefore, involved in various physiological and pathophysiological processes. A C825T polymorphism located in exon 10 of GNB3 was described in 1998 and the T allele was associated with alternative splicing and with increased signal transduction in human cells and tissues. In several disease-association studies, the 825T allele could be linked to hypertension, obesity, and depression. Meta-analysis available for hypertension and depression confirmed association with these phenotypes. On the basis of these findings, subsequent studies investigated whether the C825T polymorphism serves as a pharmacogenetic marker. Most pharmacogenetic investigations have focused on the treatment of hypertension, obesity, and depression. In this study, we will comprehensively describe and discuss these studies.
