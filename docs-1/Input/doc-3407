The Prader-Willi syndrome chromosome region on the long arm of human chromosome 15 was microdissected and microcloned from 20 GTG-banded metaphase chromosomes, and 5000 recombinant clones were obtained. Of these clones, 39% identify single-copy human DNA sequences, most of which map to the dissected chromosome region and are evolutionarily conserved in other species. Three of eleven clones studied in detail are deleted in several patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. The microclones will be useful for the physical characterization of the Prader-Willi syndrome chromosome region and the identification of the affected genes in this disease.
