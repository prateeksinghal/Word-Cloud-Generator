We recently cloned one of spliced variant forms of rat leptin receptor (OB-R), which contains a short intracellular domain, and found obese-phenotype-linked nucleotide alteration in the extracellular domain of the cDNA from the Zucker (fa/fa) rat, which results in a glutamine269 to proline269 amino acid substitution. Reported herein are the cloning and sequencing of another spliced variant forms of rat OB-R cDNA with a long intracellular domain. Both forms of OB-R cDNA share the same extracellular domain. In the Zucker (fa/fa) rat, no changes in either the gene structure nor in the nucleotide sequence of the long intracellular domain were observed. However, the expression level of OB-R mRNA in the brain of Zucker (fa/fa) rat was higher than for lean littermates. These facts suggest that the substitution at codon 269 of the OB-R cDNA represents the crucial mutation which results in the obese phenotype of Zucker (fa/fa) rat.
