Previous studies have suggested that ENPP1, INSIG2, and PLIN may be linked with a higher risk for obesity or with increased phenotypic measures of obesity. We selected polymorphisms in these candidate genes based on their prior associations with obesity risk or obesity parameters. K121Q (rs1044498) in ENPP1, rs7566605 in INSIG2, and rs894160 in PLIN were genotyped by Taqman assays in a Belgian sample of 1,078 obese subjects (body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30 kg/m(2)) and 323 lean controls (18.5 &lt; BMI &lt; 25 kg/m(2)). BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were assessed by standard methods while a computerized tomography-scan was used to measure visceral (VFA), subcutaneous (SFA), and total (TFA) abdominal fat areas. Presence of the rare allele was not significantly different between cases and controls for the three variants that were tested, while only WHR was associated with ENPP1 in obese subjects. Our data thus indicate that K121Q, rs7566605, and rs894160 are not major contributing factors for obesity.
