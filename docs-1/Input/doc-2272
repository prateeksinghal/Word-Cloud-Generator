Loss-of-function mutations in the human melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) are associated with obesity. Previous work has implicated a C-terminal di-isoleucine motif at residues 316/317 in MC4R cell surface targeting. It was therefore of interest to examine function and cell surface expression of an MC4R mutation found in an obese proband in which one of these isoleucines was substituted by threonine (I317T). Single mutant (I316T or I317T) and double mutant (I316T,I317T) forms of MC4R were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and tested for function and cell surface expression in transfected cells. Function was assessed using assays for agonist, [Nle(4)-d-Phe(7)]alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (NDP-alpha-MSH) or forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Cell surface expression was determined by whole-cell binding of [(125)I]NDP-alpha-MSH, fluorescence immunocytochemistry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Maximal cAMP generation of the single mutants was reduced by 40% of wild-type receptor; the double mutant further reduced function to 40% of control, effects that were mirrored by decreases in cell-surface expression. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that, relative to wild-type receptor, transcript levels for the mutated receptors were not reduced. The results further implicate the C-terminal di-isoleucines in cell surface expression of MC4R and suggest that mutations of residues 316 or 317 would predict MC4R hypofunction.
