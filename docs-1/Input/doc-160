Differentiation and metabolism of adipose tissue are modulated by thyroid hormones (THs), but relatively little is known about the metabolism of THs in this tissue. Expression of the genes for type I iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (D1), leptin (LEP) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) was evaluated in omental (OM) and subcutaneous (SC) fat using a cohort of 70 humans. Activities of iodothyronine deiodinases (D1, D2 and D3) were assessed in a randomly selected subpopulation of 19 subjects. D1 expression was upregulated in both OM (P=0.011) and SC (P=0.003) fat of obese subjects. Concomitantly, OM (P=0.002) and SC (P=0.028) LEP expression were increased in obesity, associated with both D1 mRNA (r=0.315, P=0.014) and activity (r=0.647, P=0.023) and inversely related to SCD-1 (r=-0.266, P=0.034) expression in SC fat. Also D1 (but not D2 and D3) activity was increased in OM (∼fourfold, P=0.010) and SC (∼eightfold, P=0.004) fat of obese when compared with non-obese subjects and correlated in both OM (r=0.528, P=0.036) and SC (r=0.749, P=0.005) fat with body mass index. Our results document increased D1 gene expression and activity in adipose tissue of obese humans and suggest a role of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine formed by D1 in response to leptin in the modulation of adipose tissue metabolism.
