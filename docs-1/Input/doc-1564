The paper reviews the structure and role of adiponectin in the regulation of metabolic balance. Adiponectin is the most abundant adipocytokine that is produced exclusively in the fat tissue. Its high concentration protects from diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis and insulin resistance, its low concentration increases the risk of these disorders. The adiponectin gene is one of the many candidate genes in type 2 diabetes. Adiponectin binds to two types of receptors: 1 and 2, encoded by two genes: AdipoR1, and AdipoR2, respectively. The receptors are found in all tissues, with type 1 predominant in the muscles, and type 2 in the liver. Most importantly, the role of adiponectin in the body and the results of animal model experiments suggest the possible future use of adiponectin in the treatment of diabetes, atherosclerosis and obesity.
