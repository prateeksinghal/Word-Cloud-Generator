In addition to its role in human pigmentation, components of the melanocortin system regulate appetite, energy homeostasis and hormone production. Recent studies have suggested possible roles of this system in immunity, transmission of pain signals, and reproductive potential. A number of polymorphisms have been identified in genes of the melanocortin system and are associated with pigmentation in humans, as well as being causative of disorders of adrenal hormone production and obesity. This review gives an outline of these polymorphisms, their functional significance and possible application to or impact on diagnosis and pharmacotherapy based on melanocortin pathways.
