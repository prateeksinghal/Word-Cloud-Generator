Heterozygous coding mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) are implicated in 1 to 6% of early onset or severe adult obesity cases. To better address the problem of the genotype:phenotype relationship within this specific form of obesity, we systematically studied the functional characteristics of 50 different obesity-associated MC4R mutations. Structure modeling of MC4R indicates that obesity-associated MC4R mutations are not localized in a single domain of the protein. We developed a flow cytometry-based assay to compare cell membrane expression of obesity-associated MC4R mutants. Using this assay, we demonstrate that over 54% of the obesity-associated MC4R mutations impair the membrane expression of MC4R. All other mutations impair the basal constitutive activity and/or the EC(50) for the physiological agonist alpha-MSH as measured in a cAMP- dependent luciferase assay. The extent of the alterations in receptor activity ranges from a total suppression of MC4R activation in response to alpha-MSH to a mild alteration of the basal constitutive activity of the receptor. Since most patients are heterozygous for MC4R mutations, these data indicate that a small decrease in overall MC4R activity can cause obesity, strongly supporting the hypothesis that the MC4R is a critical component of the adipostat in humans.
