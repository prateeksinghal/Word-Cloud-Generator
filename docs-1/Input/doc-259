The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a key regulator of adipogenesis and is medically important for its connections to obesity and the treatment of type II diabetes. Activation of this receptor by certain natural or xenobiotic compounds has been shown to stimulate adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Obesogens are chemicals that ultimately increase obesity through a variety of potential mechanisms, including activation of PPARγ. The first obesogen for which a definitive mechanism of action has been elucidated is the PPARγ and RXR activator tributyltin; however, not all chemicals that activate PPARγ are adipogenic or correlated with obesity in humans. There are multiple mechanisms through which obesogens can target PPARγ that may not involve direct activation of the receptor. Ligand-independent mechanisms could act through obesogen-mediated post-translational modification of PPARγ which cause receptor de-repression or activation. PPARγ is active in multipotent stem cells committing to the adipocyte fate during fat cell development. By modifying chromatin structure early in development, obesogens have the opportunity to influence the promoter activity of PPARγ, or the ability of PPARγ to bind to its target genes, ultimately biasing the progenitor pool towards the fat lineage. Obesogens that act by directly or indirectly activating PPARγ, by increasing the levels of PPARγ protein, or enhancing its recruitment to promoters of key genes in the adipogenic pathway may ultimately play an important role in adipogenesis and obesity.
