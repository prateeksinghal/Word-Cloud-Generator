This study investigated the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs3808607 and rs1125226) within the CYP7A1 promoter and hypertension susceptibility in a Han Chinese population. From 2003 through 2006, a population-based case-control study was performed in a cohort of 1187 randomly selected Han Chinese subjects. A sib-pair study for a transmission disequilibrium test analysis was carried out in 76 hypertensive (HT) families (n=312) from northeastern Liaoning province. SNPs were detected using real-time PCR. No significant differences were found in the genotype or allele frequencies of either SNP (P&gt;0.05), with no excessive allele sharing. For rs3808607, the frequency of the AA genotype in obese hypertensive patients was 31.91%, significantly higher than in normotensive (NT) subjects (12.73%; odds ratio (OR)=3.21, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.35-7.66). For rs3808607, the AA genotype frequency was significantly higher in obese male HT subjects (27.87%) than in matched NTs (7.41%; OR=4.83, 95% CI=1.03-22.65). After adjustment for environmental risk factors in obese participants, the AA genotype was associated with hypertension (OR=3.395, 95% CI=1.412-8.162). Among subjects with body mass index 28 kg m(-2), the HT and NT groups had significantly different frequencies of Hap I (C/C) and Hap IV (A/A). The frequencies of rs3808607 alleles in the CYP7A1 gene differed significantly between obese HT and NT men. Haplotypes I and IV were associated with hypertension in obese participants.
