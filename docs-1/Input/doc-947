Colostrinin (CLN) is a uniform mixture of low-molecular weight proline-rich polypeptides isolated from the mother's first milk, colostrum. Exposure of cells to CLN decreases intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species by regulating glutathione metabolism and modulating activities of antioxidant enzymes and mitochondrial function. It also inhibits beta amyloid-induced apoptosis and induces neurite outgrowth of pheochromocytoma cells. Administration of CLN to Alzheimer's disease patients has resulted in a stabilizing effect on cognitive function. We analyzed CLN-induced gene expression changes using high-density oligonucleotide arrays and transcriptomal network analysis. We found that CLN elicited highly complex and multiphasic changes in the gene expression profile of treated cells. CLN treatment affected a total of 58 molecular networks, 27 of which contained at least 10 differentially expressed genes. Here we present CLN-modulated gene networks as potential underlying molecular mechanisms leading to the reported effects of CLN on cellular oxidative state, chemokine and cytokine production, and cell differentiation, as well as on pathological processes like allergy, asthma, Alzheimer's, and other neurological diseases. Based on our results, we also predict possible modulatory effects of CLN on adipocytokine gene networks that play a crucial role in the pathobiology of diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, obesity, and inflammation. Taken together, CLN-altered gene expression networks presented here provide the molecular basis for previously described biological phenomena and predict potential fields of application for CLN in the prevention and treatment of diseases.
