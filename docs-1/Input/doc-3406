Human obesity shows clustering within families. The hypothesis for the presence of a major gene or genes acting in human obesity is supported by recent evidence from studies of obesity in adoptees and their biological parents and siblings. The heterogeneity of obesity may be demonstrated by the shape of fat distribution and the prolactin response to insulin hypoglycaemia. Fat distribution has been shown to have a genetic background whereas a primary disorder of hypothalamic function is suspected in obese women who show an impaired prolactin response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. We have investigated the possible association between fat distribution and hypothalamic function in 23 extremely obese, nondiabetic premenopausal women who have been characterized using their absolute body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat distribution (expressed as waist to hip ratio), fasting insulin, basal prolactin and prolactin response to hypoglycaemia. Fasting insulin values showed a significant correlation (P less than 0.05, R = 0.604) with increasing waist to hip ratio (upper body segment obesity), whereas the graded prolactin response to hypoglycaemia of the obese women showed a negative association with increasing upper body segment obesity (P less than 0.05; R = -0.446). No relationship was observed between fasting insulin and the prolactin response to hypoglycaemia. We suggest that this previously unrecognized association of an impaired prolactin response to hypoglycaemia and upper body segment fatness may be useful for the investigation of the genetics of obesity.
