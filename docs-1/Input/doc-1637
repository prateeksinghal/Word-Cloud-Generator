Obesity is a major health problem. It increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, 2-type diabetes mellitus, cancers, and premature mortality. Apart from some monogenic forms, it's a polygenic disorder, the result of interaction of genes and environmental factors. Genetic variants of proteins taking part in the regulation of food intake or thermogenesis and tissue mediators produced by the adipose tissue are responsible the genetic components of obesity. Identification of the genetic background of the obesity will help to understand the exact molecular mechanism of the pathogenesis, make possible the prevention, as well as individual therapeutic interventions.
