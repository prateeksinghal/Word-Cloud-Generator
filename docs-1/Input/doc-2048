This is the tenth update of the human obesity gene map, incorporating published results up to the end of October 2003 and continuing the previous format. Evidence from single-gene mutation obesity cases, Mendelian disorders exhibiting obesity as a clinical feature, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from human genome-wide scans and animal crossbreeding experiments, and association and linkage studies with candidate genes and other markers is reviewed. Transgenic and knockout murine models relevant to obesity are also incorporated (N = 55). As of October 2003, 41 Mendelian syndromes relevant to human obesity have been mapped to a genomic region, and causal genes or strong candidates have been identified for most of these syndromes. QTLs reported from animal models currently number 183. There are 208 human QTLs for obesity phenotypes from genome-wide scans and candidate regions in targeted studies. A total of 35 genomic regions harbor QTLs replicated among two to five studies. Attempts to relate DNA sequence variation in specific genes to obesity phenotypes continue to grow, with 272 studies reporting positive associations with 90 candidate genes. Fifteen such candidate genes are supported by at least five positive studies. The obesity gene map shows putative loci on all chromosomes except Y. Overall, more than 430 genes, markers, and chromosomal regions have been associated or linked with human obesity phenotypes.
