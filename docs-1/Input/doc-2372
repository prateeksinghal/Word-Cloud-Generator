PCOS is the most frequent endocrine disorder of premenopausal women. The common clinical signs of PCOS are hirsutism, menstrual irregularities with chronic anovulation and a trend toward overweight or obesity. Diagnosis is based upon high plasma levels of androgens and the ultrasound image of polycystic ovaries. The high prevalence of PCOS at first degree female relatives suggest an important genetic component of this syndrome. Linking studies in sisters presenting phenotypical traits of PCOS and in their parents allowed the investigation of certain candidate genes presumed to be involved in the physiopathology of PCOS. The genes encoding enzymes involved in androgen synthesis, protein transducers of insulin signals and the paracrine regulating factors of gonadotrophins and ovarian function have been analysed. To date, no determinant gene mutation was reported. However, several loci were detected, especially a locus within the insulin receptor. Mutations or gene polymorphisms and their function remain to be identified. These research attempts should explain the physiopathology of PCOS and open new therapeutic perspectives. The usage of medication increasing the sensitivity to insulin action is an example of applying these particular aspects.
