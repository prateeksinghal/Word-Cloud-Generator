Great progress has been made in identifying several genes and in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of inherited syndromes of obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM). In humans, mutations in leptin, leptin receptor, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and prohormone convertase 1 (PC1) have been described in patients with severe obesity. Most of these obesity disorders, with the exception of the MC4R mutations, exhibit recessive inheritance and a distinct phenotype with varying degrees of hypothalamic dysfunction, and they unravel the critical role of the central leptin and melanocortin pathways in human appetite control and energy homeostasis. Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous subtype of type 2 DM with early onset autosomal dominant inheritance and a primary defect in insulin secretion. To date, six MODY genes have been identified, the glucokinase gene and five beta cell-specific transcription factor genes, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha), HNF-1beta, HNF-4alpha, insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1) and NeuroD1/BETA2. Mitochondrial DNA mutations cause another form of DM with an insulin secretory defect that is commonly associated with neurosensory hearing impairment, and has strict maternal inheritance. At the other end of the spectrum are the inherited syndromes of insulin resistance that are caused by mutations in the insulin receptor gene and in the adipocyte-specific transcription factor PPARgamma. The advances in our knowledge of the phenotypic manifestations and underlying molecular mechanisms of genetic syndromes of obesity and DM raise expectations for molecular diagnosis, as well as for more etiological therapies and better prevention of the continuously increasing prevalence of obesity and DM in our modern societies.
