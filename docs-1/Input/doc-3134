Recent twin studies show that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of eating disorders. As in many other fields, there is much enthusiasm regarding the possibility of locating the specific genes that influence the risk of eating disorders. Advances in molecular and statistical technology have made this task more feasible than it was in the past, and continued enhancements in new technology are expected in the future. Despite these advances, the resources required to map a gene for traits as complex as eating disorders are likely to be enormous. Researchers considering such an undertaking may wish to look for ways to reduce this demand, such as (1) using multivariate analyses, (2) studying intermediate quantitative phenotypes, (3) using large sibships, (4) analytic enhancements (e.g., multipoint analyses), (5) reconceptualizing power, (6) data pooling, and (7) disequilibrium mapping.
