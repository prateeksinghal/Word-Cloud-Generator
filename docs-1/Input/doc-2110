The presence of Helicobacter DNA species has been investigated in the biliary epithelium of patients with biliary diseases. However, conflicting results have been observed that may have been due to the small number of subjects studied, difficulty in obtaining a healthy control group, absence of controlling for confounding factors, or differences among populations. Therefore, we investigated the presence of Helicobacter species by culture and nested PCR of 16S rRNA genes in gallbladder tissue and bile from 46 Brazilian subjects with and 18 without cholelithiasis. The control group was mainly composed of liver donors and of patients who had submitted to cholecystectomy as part of the surgical treatment for morbid obesity. No Helicobacter species were grown from the bile or gallbladder tissues. Helicobacter DNA was detected in the gallbladder tissue and bile from 31.3 and 42.9% of the patients, respectively. In a logistic regression model, cholelithiasis was positively and independently associated with the female gender (P = 0.02), increasing age (P = 0.002), and the presence of Helicobacter DNA in the gallbladder tissue (P = 0.009). The presence of Helicobacter DNA in the bile was not associated with cholelithiasis (P = 0.8). A significant association between the presence of Helicobacter DNA in the gallbladder epithelium and histological cholecystitis, even after adjusting for gender and age (P = 0.002), was also observed. The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes were &gt;99% similar to that of Helicobacter pylori. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that Helicobacter is associated with the pathogenesis of human cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.
