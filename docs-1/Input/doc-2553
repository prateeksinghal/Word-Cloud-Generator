The finding of nuclear receptors has greatly enhanced our understanding of gene regulation by lipophilic hormones such as steroids, thyroxine, vitamin D and retinoids. These receptors comprise a superfamily of transcription factors containing highly related DNA-binding domains. In mammals, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family of nuclear hormone receptors consists of three subtypes by separate genes: PPAR alpha, PPAR delta (also referred to as hNUC1 or PPAR beta), and PPAR gamma. PPARs have been associated with several distinct biological programs. PPARs function as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor. This complex binds to sequences termed direct repeat-1 response element in enhancer sites of regulated genes and activates transcription upon ligand and coactivator binding. Three different PPAR subtypes have specific roles in different organs. PPAR alpha, mainly expressed in liver, plays an important role in fatty acid metabolism. PPAR gamma predominantly is expressed in adipose cells. PPAR delta displays a high level of expression in lipid-metabolizing organs such as small intestine, heart and adipose tissue. Naturally occurring and synthetic molecules (anti-hyperlipidemia and diabetic drugs) that are ligands for these nuclear receptors control transcriptional activity of PPARs. We believe that the pharmacological and genomic researches on PPAR will develop powerful tools for prevention and medical care against common diseases.
