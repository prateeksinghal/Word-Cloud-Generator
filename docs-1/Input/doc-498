According to recent genome-wide association studies, a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms is reported to be associated with diseases or several clinical markers. Among them, adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and perilipin (PLIN) polymorphisms are major factors of obesity. However, the association between lifestyle factor, these polymorphisms and obesity-related clinical markers in Japanese is not well researched. Therefore, the aim of present study is to investigate the association between lifestyle factor, polymorphisms of lipid metabolic genes, and clinical markers in 148 middle-aged Japanese males. The study revealed that ADIPOQ 45 T&gt;G and ADIPOQ 276 G&gt;T genotypes were significantly associated with triglyceride, total cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in blood and body mass index (BMI). PLIN4 11482 G&gt;A and hormone sensitive lipase (LIPE)-60 C&gt;G genotypes were respectively associated with BMI and serum triglyceride. Not only genetic factors but also lifestyle factors influence several clinical markers. The BMI of subjects who like sweets and have the GG allele in ADIPOQ 276 G&gt;T was higher than that of subjects who don't like sweets. The habit of eating fruits and fish affected low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol of the GT allele and HbA1c of the TT allele in ADIPOQ 276 G&gt;T. Those findings indicate improvement and conservation of lifestyle depending on genetic predisposition in ADIPOQ, PLIN and LIPE should be encouraged.
