A new approach, SiteGA, for the prediction of functional transcription factor binding sites has been developed. The approach is based on the detection of locally positioned dinucleotides by the genetic algorithm and discriminant analysis. The approach has been applied to recognize transcription factor binding sites involved in the regulation of immune responses and cell growth (AP-1, IRF1, ISGF3, NFkappaB, STAT1), obesity and lipid metabolism (HNF4, PPAR, SREBP), and the expression of steroidogenesis genes (SF-1). SiteGA is far superior in accuracy to the traditionally used method of position weight matrices. The approach was implemented in the web tool, SiteGA http://wwwmgs2. bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/sitega.
