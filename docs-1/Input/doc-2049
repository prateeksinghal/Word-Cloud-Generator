Low birth weight is according to many studies associated with later incidence of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and in lower degree with obesity and hypertriacylglycerolemia. Detection of history of low birth weight could have some importance in detection of persons with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk. In the pathogenesis can be involved fetal selection of thrifty genes which are later unable to overcome low physical activity and overfeeding in adult age. More probable is that low birth weight is primary of genetic origin. The same genetic origin can be involved in BMI rebound in childhood, development of insulin resistance, weight gain and later incidence of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Detection of all these phenomena is important in selecting patients in diabetes and cardiovascular risk for preventive intervention.
