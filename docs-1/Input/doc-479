Obesity and its associated complications, including diabetes, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and some cancers, have been a global health problem with a rapid increase of the obese population. In this study, we selected 31 obesity candidate genes in the liver of high-fat-induced obese C57BL/6J mice through investigation of literature search and analyzed functional protein-protein interaction of the genes using the STRING database. Most of the obesity candidate genes were closely connected through lipid metabolism, and in particular acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 appeared to be a core obesity gene. Overall, genes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, and gluconeogenesis were up-regulated, and genes involved in sterol biosynthesis, insulin signaling, and oxidative stress defense system were down-regulated with a high-fat diet. Future identification of core obesity genes and their functional targets is expected to provide a new way to prevent obesity by phytochemicals or functional foods on the basis of food and nutritional genomics.
