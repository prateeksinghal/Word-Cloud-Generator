The influence of apolipoprotein (apo) E polymorphism on the association between body fatness and concentrations of serum lipoprotein variables was studied in a random subsample (n = 892) of 8- to 17-year-old children from a total community. Covariates (age, race, and sex)-adjusted mean values of percent body fat, ponderal index (wt/ht3), and subscapular skinfold thickness differed significantly among apo E phenotype groups, with the apo E2 group (n = 61) carrying E2/2 and E3/2 phenotypes having significantly (P &lt; .01) lower values than the apo E3 group (n = 480) carrying the E3/3 phenotype. In the apo E3 group, covariates-adjusted partial correlation coefficients showed significant (P &lt; .05 to P &lt; .001) associations between obesity measures and lipoprotein variables studied that are generally seen in populations. However, these associations, with the exception of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apo B, were altered in the other apo E phenotype groups. In the apo E2 group, obesity measures correlated significantly with triglycerides (P &lt; .05 to P &lt; .001), but not with very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and apo A-I. In contrast, in the apo E4 group (n = 212) carrying E4/3 and E4/4 phenotypes, obesity measures correlated significantly with HDL cholesterol (P &lt; .05 to P &lt; .001) and apo A-I (P &lt; .01), but not with triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol. Therefore, the apo E phenotype should be taken into account in the association between body fatness and serum lipoproteins.
