Regular aerobic exercise has the potential to induce several beneficial health effects, including a decrease in blood pressure level, especially in hypertensive patients and in subjects with high-normal blood pressure. However, it is also well documented that some people show more pronounced blood pressure responses to endurance training than others, despite identical training programs and similar initial blood pressure levels. This kind of variation is an example of normal biologic diversity and most likely originates from interactions with genetic factors. Data from genetic epidemiologic studies indicate that there is a genetic component that affects both resting blood pressure and blood pressure responses to acute exercise. Evidence from molecular genetic studies is scarce, but the first reports suggest that DNA sequence variation in the hypertension candidate genes, such as angiotensinogen, also modify blood pressure responses to endurance training. The current knowledge regarding the role of genetic factors in the modification of blood pressure responses to endurance training will be summarized and discussed.
