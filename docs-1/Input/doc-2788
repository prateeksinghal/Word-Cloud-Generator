An 8-year-old boy with partial trisomy 14q and phenotype distinct from previously reported cases is described. The mother carries a balanced 9;14 reciprocal translocation. The patient presented with minor facial anomalies, developmental delay, hyperphagia, and obesity. Imprinting of maternal chromosome 14 or disruption of one or more genes on chromosome 9 may be responsible for our patient's manifestations.
