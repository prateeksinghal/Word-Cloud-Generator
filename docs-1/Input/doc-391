Nuclear receptors (NRs) play pivotal roles in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and homeostasis. Recent progress demonstrates that NR is tightly linked to human disease such as cancer, diabetes and obesity. Here we explore NR expression profiles in human tissue using systematic approaches. NR gene profiles reveal that individual NR has its own gene expression signature depending on tissue type. Of many organs, NRs expression is enriched in liver. Expression of many NRs was significantly changed in liver cancer. Notably, NR0B2/SHP expression level was significantly decreased in human liver cancer but not in normal liver. In addition, expression of SHP is well associated with good prognosis. SHP gene network analysis based on microarray data in liver cancer shows that SHP regulates cell proliferation and metabolism related gene sets. Our systematic approaches suggest that loss of SHP expression in liver might be key genetic events during hepatocarcinogenesis.
