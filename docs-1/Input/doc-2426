The prevalence of obesity has increased to an extraordinary degree, especially over the last three decades, so that if these trends persist, practically all of the adult population would be obese in the course of only two generations. On the basis of family and adoption studies, it has been estimated that the genetic component in obesity ranges from 20% to 80%. Thus, the most common forms of obesity would depend on the interaction of multiple genes as well as on the influence of various environmental factors, such as eating behaviour and lifestyle. Although none of these genes potentially involved in the control of body weight seems to be directly responsible for the syndrome, there have been reports of interesting associations between polymorphisms of certain candidate genes and obesity or its metabolic complications. The studies into associations between genotypes and obese phenotype have increased over the last few years and have basically focussed on the genes involved in the control of the energy balance, giving rise to a whole series of results which might constitute the basis for extremely interesting strategies for the prevention and treatment of this serious problem.
