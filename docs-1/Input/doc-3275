Obesity is a remarkable heterogeneous condition as shown by the variety of metabolic complications encountered. Imaging techniques with computed tomography have made it possible to quantify adipose tissue deposited within the abdominal cavity (visceral fat) which has been found to be correlated with serum glucose, insulin and lipid levels. Individuals with excessive visceral fat have hypertriglyceridaemia, high apolipoprotein B levels and hypoalphalipoproteinaemia. Several genes could modulate the degree of dyslipidaemia in patients with excessive visceral fat. Consequently, these patients should be managed as a genetically identifiable subgroup at risk of developing metabolic complications of obesity. It would also be justified to focus treatment on mobilizing visceral fat and improving the metabolic syndrome rather than simply on weight loss, an often unrealistic and clinically unjustified objective.
