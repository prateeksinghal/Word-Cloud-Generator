The ubiquitously expressed acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) is involved in lipid metabolism and is regulated by hormones and feeding status via transcription factors such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). In humans, two transcripts encoding proteins of 86 and 104 amino acids are known, whereas in mouse only one protein of 86 amino acids is described. We identified new transcripts in human and mouse tissues, that had been generated by alternative first exon usage. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed a high expression of the new human transcript, ACBP-1c, in adipose tissue. By promoter reporter gene assays, specific regulation of this transcript by PPARgamma2 was revealed, implicating the usage of an alternative promoter that contains a PPARgamma responsive element. Subcellular localizations of the known human proteins and the new variant showed an occurrence in cytoplasma and nucleus. Reported studies concerning ACBP gene regulation should be re-evaluated with respect to a new ACBP gene model. Given the fact that the new variant is highly expressed in adipose tissue and a PPARgamma target, it might be relevant for diseases like diabetes and obesity.
