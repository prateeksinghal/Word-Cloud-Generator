The first unifying definition for the metabolic syndrome was proposed by WHO in 1998. In accordance to this, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance have the syndrome if they fulfil two of the criteria: hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity/abdominal obesity and microalbuminuria. Persons with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) should also be insulin resistant. About 40% of persons with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes have features of the syndrome. Importantly, presence of the dysmetabolic syndrome is associated with reduced survival, particularly because of increased cardiovascular mortality. The dysmetabolic syndrome most likely results from interplay between several genes and an affluent environment. Compatible with the thrifty gene theory, common variants in genes regulating lipolysis, thermogenesis and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle account for a large part of such thrifty genes. However, hitherto unknown genes may still be identified by random gene approaches.
