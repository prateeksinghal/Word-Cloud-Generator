The defining characteristic of obesity is increased adipose tissue (AT) mass following chronic positive energy supply. AT mass is determined by adipocyte number and size, which reflect proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes and hypertrophy of pre-existing adipocytes. The molecular pathways governing AT expansion are incompletely defined. We previously reported that FGF-1 primes proliferating primary human preadipocytes (phPA), thereby increasing adipogenesis. Here we examined whether FGF-1's adipogenic actions were due to modulation of other FGFs. Treatment of phPA with FGF-1 reduced FGF-2 mRNA/protein by 80%. To examine a putative functional role we performed siRNA knockdown studies. Following FGF-2 knockdown preadipocyte proliferation was decreased and expression of adipogenic genes (PPARÎ³, G3PDH and adiponectin) was increased at day 1 of differentiation. These results suggest that changes in endogenous FGF-2 levels contribute to FGF-1's early adipogenic effects and highlight the complexity of the paracrine interplay between FGFs within human AT.
