Adipocyte dysfunction is associated with the development of obesity. This study shows that 6-thioinosine inhibits adipocyte differentiation. The mRNA levels of PPAR gamma and C/EBPalpha, but not C/EBPbeta and delta, were reduced by 6-thioinosine. Moreover, the mRNA levels of PPAR gamma target genes (LPL, CD36, aP2, and LXRalpha) were down-regulated by 6-thioinosine. We also demonstrated that 6-thioinosine inhibits the transactivation activity and the mRNA level of PPAR gamma. Additionally, attempts to elucidate a possible mechanism underlying the 6-thioinosine-mediated effects revealed that 6-thioinosine induced iNOS gene expression without impacting eNOS expression, and that this was mediated through activation of AP-1, especially, JNK. In addition, 6-thioinosine was found to operate upstream of MEKK-1 in JNK activation signaling. Taken together, these findings suggest that the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation by 6-thioinosine occurs primarily through the reduced expression of PPAR gamma, which is mediated by upregulation of iNOS via the activation of JNK.
