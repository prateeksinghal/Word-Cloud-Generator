The mouse is a proven model for studying human disease. Many strains exist that exhibit either natural or engineered genetic variation and thereby enable the elucidation of pathways involved in the development of cardiovascular disease. Although those mouse models have been fundamental to advancing our knowledge base, we are still at an early stage in understanding how genes contribute to complex disorders. There remains a need for new animal models that closely represent human disease. To expedite their development, we have established the Center for New Mouse Models of Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Disorders at The Jackson Laboratory. We are using a phenotype-driven approach to identify mutations leading to atherosclerosis, hypertension, obesity, blood disorders, lung dysfunction, thrombosis, and disordered sleep. Our high-throughput, comprehensive phenotyping draws from two sources for new models: 1) the natural variation among over 40 inbred mouse strains and 2) chemically induced, whole-genome mutagenized mice. Here, we review our cardiovascular screens and present some hypertensive, obese, and cardiovascular models identified with this approach.
