Adiponectin (also called AdipoQ, gelatin-binding protein 28, Acrp30) DNA sequence variants were determined in 96 unrelated female subjects with severe obesity (mean body mass index [BMI], 42.3 kg/m2) and in 96 non-obese female controls (mean BMI, 23.0 kg/m2) from the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) cohort. A single base substitution (T45G) at codon 15 of exon 2 resulting in no change in amino acid (Gly15Gly) was found in equal frequencies among obese and control subjects. However, this polymorphism was associated with serum cholesterol and waist circumference (P=.023 and.043, respectively) in the obese group. A IVS2 + G62T sequence variation was also identified, but had similar prevalence rates in obese and control subjects. Blood glucose was highest in the obese female subjects who were homozygotes for the G allele (GG) of the IVS2 + G62T polymorphism (N=56; P=.033) and all the diabetics (n=6) in this sample were in this group. IVS2 + G62T polymorphism was also associated with BMI (P=.014), diastolic blood pressure (P=.009), and sagittal diameter (P=.032). A missense point mutation at codon 111 (Tyr111His) was not associated with any obesity-related phenotypes. In conclusion, adiponectin DNA sequence variations might play a role in the complications of morbid obesity and should be further investigated.
