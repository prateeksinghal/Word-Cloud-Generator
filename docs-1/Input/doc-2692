Multiple metabolic syndrome (MMS) implies a frequent coincidence of four basic serious metabolic risk factors for subsequent manifestation of cardiovascular disease. The latter include: central type obesity, arterial hypertension, dyslipoproteinaemia and diabetes mellitus type II (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus--NIDDM). MMS is also described as syndrome X, Reaven's syndrome, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome or as the &quot;deadly quartet&quot;. NIDDM in humans is conceived as a syndrome the pathogenesis of which is multifactorial and it is not an unequivocal nosological unit. It many epidemiological studies reliable evidence was provided that in the aetiology of NIDDM a marked genetic influence is involved. Its genetic predisposition is conditioned by the interaction of candidate genes and a complex of influences of the external environment. Evidence was provided that MMS phenotypes cumulate only in members of some families. The mode of genetic transmission of NIDDM remains obscure.
