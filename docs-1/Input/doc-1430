Obesity, which results from adipose differentiation and adipocyte hypertrophy, is a primary risk factor of these life-style-diseases. Obesity, is primary risk factor of these life-style-diseases, results from adipose differentiation and adipocyte hypertrophy. Adipose differentiation is regulated by several transcriptional factors, and we have focused here on the roles played by endothelial PAS domain protein1 (EPAS1) in adipogenesis. EPAS1 was identified as a factor responsible for hypoxia responses, such as angiogenesis, here we demonstrated that EPAS1 is highly induced during adipose differentiation in vivo and in vitro. We then analyzed EPAS1 promoter activity during adipose differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. We showed that the sequence -478/-445 is responsible for the up-regulation of EPAS1 expression during adipose differentiation and that the activity of this region is controlled by Sp1 and Sp3. To examine whether EPAS1 exerts an influence on adipogenesis, we overexpressed dominant negative form of EPAS1 in 3T3-L1 cells. The expression of EPAS1 (1-485) allowed cells to accumulate only a minimum amount of lipid droplets. Therefore, induction of EPAS1 expression is necessary for execution of adipose differentiation program. The mechanism involves the direct transcriptional regulation of Glut1, Glut4 and IRS3 genes by EPAS1. These results also confirmed that the protein level of EPAS1 was increased by insulin stimulation in adipocytes. Taken together, this result also indicated that EPAS1 plays a role in the part of insulin action. Therefore, these results suggest that the quantitative and functional alteration of EPAS1 are involved in metabolic syndrome occurrence.
