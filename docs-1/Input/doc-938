Thirteen candidate genes for human obesity were selected for cytogenetic mapping by FISH in the pig genome. Among them, 6 genes were assigned to chromosomes for the first time (NR3C1, GNB3, ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3 and UCP1). Location of the other 7 genes (INSIG2, LIPIN1, PLIN, NAMPT, ADIPOQ, UCP2 and UCP3), earlier mapped by somatic cell hybridization or with the use of a radiation hybrid panel, was verified (INSIG2) or more precisely described. The genes were assigned to the following chromosomes: INSIG2 to SSC15q12, LIPIN1 to SSC3q26, NR3C1 to SSC2q29, PLIN to SSC7q15, GNB3 to SSC5q21, NAMPT to SSC9q23, ADIPOQ to SSC13q41, ADRB1 to SSC14q28, ADRB2 to SSC2q29, ADRB3 to SSC15q13-14, UCP1 to SSC8q21-22, and both UCP2 and UCP3 to SSC9p24. Most of the genes were located within known QTL for pig fatness traits.
