The rising prevalence of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, has become a public health concern. Vitamin A (VA, retinol) is an essential micronutrient for a variety of physiological processes, such as tissue differentiation, immunity, and vision. However, its role in glucose and lipid metabolism has not been clearly defined. VA activities are mediated by the metabolite of retinol catabolism, retinoic acid, which activates the retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor (RXR). Since RXR is an obligate heterodimeric partner for many nuclear receptors involved in metabolism, it is reasonable to assume that VA status and retinoids contribute to glucose and lipid homeostasis. To date, the impacts of VA and retinoids on energy metabolism in animals and humans have been demonstrated in some basic and clinical investigations. This review summarizes the effects of VA status and retinoid treatments on metabolism of the liver, adipocytes, pancreatic Î²-cells, and skeletal muscle. It proposes a mechanism by which the dietary and hormonal signals converge on the promoter of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c gene to induce its expression, and in turn, the expression of lipogenic genes in hepatocytes. Future research projects relevant to the VA's roles in metabolic diseases are also discussed.
