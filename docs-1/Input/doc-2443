This report constitutes the eighth update of the human obesity gene map, incorporating published results up to the end of October 2001. Evidence from the rodent and human obesity cases caused by single-gene mutations, Mendelian disorders exhibiting obesity as a clinical feature, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) uncovered in human genome-wide scans and in crossbreeding experiments in various animal models, association and linkage studies with candidate genes and other markers is reviewed. The human cases of obesity related in some way to single-gene mutations in six different genes are incorporated. Twenty-five Mendelian disorders exhibiting obesity as one of their clinical manifestations have now been mapped. The number of different QTLs reported from animal models currently reaches 165. Attempts to relate DNA sequence variation in specific genes to obesity phenotypes continue to grow, with 174 studies reporting positive associations with 58 candidate genes. Finally, 59 loci have been linked to obesity indicators in genomic scans and other linkage study designs. The obesity gene map depicted in Figure 1 reveals that putative loci affecting obesity-related phenotypes can be found on all chromosomes except chromosome Y. A total of 54 new loci have been added to the map in the past 12 months, and the number of genes, markers, and chromosomal regions that have been associated or linked with human obesity phenotypes is now above 250. Likewise, the number of negative studies, which are only partially reviewed here, is also on the rise.
