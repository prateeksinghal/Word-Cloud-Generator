The beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR), beta3AR, or uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) may play a pathogenic role in obesity. In Swedish Caucasians, a polymorphism at codon 27 (Gln27Glu) of the beta2AR gene was shown to be associated with obesity, but no such association was shown for a polymorphism of codon 16 (Arg16Gly). Thus, we investigated whether these polymorphisms contribute to obesity in 210 Japanese men. The frequencies of the Gln27Glu and Arg16Gly polymorphisms were 0.05 and 0.48, respectively, and there was no association with obesity. A strong linkage disequilibrium between the Gln27Glu and Arg16Gly polymorphisms was shown, but there was no apparent additive effect on the clinical or metabolic characteristics. Our results suggest that the Gln27Glu and Arg16Gly polymorphisms of the beta2AR gene are not a major contributing factor to obesity in Japanese men.
