There is a strong familial predisposition to type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The authors evaluated the association between a family history of these diseases and a large panel of cardiovascular risk factors in 1,431 Mexican American subjects who were enrolled in the San Antonio Family Heart Study in San Antonio, Texas. The baseline phase of the study covered 1992-1996. Diabetes and hypertension were diagnosed according to standard clinical criteria, while cardiovascular disease was defined as a history of heart attack or heart surgery. The prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease in this population was 15%, 12%, and 3%, respectively. For each unaffected subject, the authors computed a family history score based on the presence or absence of disease in parents and older siblings, and correlations between cardiovascular risk factors and family history scores were estimated by using likelihood-based variance component methods. Diabetes family history score was significantly correlated with a broad panel of cardiovascular risk factors, including glucose and insulin, obesity, blood pressure, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Hypertension family history score was significantly correlated with glucose, blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. These results support the idea that genes that confer a risk for diabetes, and to a lesser extent hypertension, adversely alter the cardiovascular risk profile long before the manifestation of clinical disease.
