Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the most abundant steroid hormone in human blood, is considered to be one of fat-reducing hormones. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying DHEA mode of action in obesity has not been fully clarified. The pivotal role in the maintenance of cellular lipid and energy balance is played by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) which acts as transcriptional activator of numerous genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid catabolism. Lately published papers suggest that resistin, a low molecular-weight protein produced by adipose tissue, may act as an inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation and could regulate adipose tissue mass. Recent studies have established that the promoter region of the resistin gene contains several putative PPAR response elements. Since DHEA has been characterized as a peroxisome proliferator able to induce hepatic genes through PPARalpha, we hypothesised that DHEA might affect PPARalpha and, subsequently, resistin gene expression in adipose tissue. In order to test this hypothesis, an experiment was performed comparing PPARalpha and resistin gene expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) of male Wistar rats fed standard or DHEA-supplemented (0.6% (w/w)) diet for 2 weeks. DHEA administration to the rats induced PPARalpha and resistin gene expression in WAT (3- and 2.25-fold, respectively; as determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)); reduced body weight, epididymal adipose tissue mass and decreased serum leptin levels. We propose that DHEA may impact on the transcription of resistin gene through a mechanism involving PPARalpha and that an elevated resistin level may lead to an inhibition of adipogenesis and a decrease in adipose tissue mass.
