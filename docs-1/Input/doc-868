Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cancer mortality, with increasing incidence. 95% of the esophageal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Although they differ in histology and epidemiology, some of their risk factors (smoking, dietary factors) and their pathogenesis are the same. More than 90% of esophageal cancer is diagnosed in late stage. Despite the development of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, esophageal cancer has poor prognosis, with 5-year survival rates between 10-13%. Understanding the exact pathogenesis can help the prevention of this highly aggressive cancer, with the use of natural substances and nonsteroid inflammatory drugs.
