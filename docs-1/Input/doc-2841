Human obesity may have genetic causes, but determining the specific genes involved has been difficult. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) gene encodes a protein that plays an important role in the differentiation of fat cells. A mutation has been discovered in this gene which leads to a receptor that cannot be inactivated. This mutation, while probably rare, is associated with extreme obesity.
