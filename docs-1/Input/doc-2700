To study the regulation of plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in postmenopausal women (n = 79), fasting plasma lipids and lipoproteins, the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and production rate for LDL apolipoprotein B (apo B), cholesterol absorption, apolipoprotein E phenotype and polymorphisms of the apo B and 7alpha-hydroxylase genes were determined. The level of LDL cholesterol was related to FCR (r= -0.757, P &lt; 0.001) and the production (r= 0.531, P &lt; 0.001) of LDL apo B and body mass index (r = 0.265, P &lt;0.05). In contrast, cholesterol absorption efficiency, apolipoprotein E phenotype, EcoRI and XbaI polymorphisms of the apo B gene and the polymorphism of 7alpha-hydroxylase gene were found to have no significance for the regulation of LDL cholesterol concentration in these postmenopausal women.
