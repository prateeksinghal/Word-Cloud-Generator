Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a nuclear receptor regulating an array of diverse functions in a variety of cell types including regulation of genes associated with growth and differentiation. Its most notable function is to regulate development of adipose tissue, which involves coordinating expression of many hundreds of genes responsible for establishment of the mature adipocyte phenotype. Our recent studies have demonstrated a role for MEK/ERK signaling and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP)beta in regulating expression of PPARgamma during adipogenesis. Furthermore, we have shown that cAMP-dependent signaling along with C/EBPbeta leads to the stimulation of PPARgamma activity by mechanisms that probably involve production of PPARgamma ligands. Additionally, we have recently demonstrated that phosphorylation of C/EBPbeta at a consensus ERK/GSK3 site is required for the PPARgamma-associated expression of adiponectin during the terminal stages of adipogenesis. GSK3beta also influences PPARgamma activity by regulating the turnover and subcellular localization of beta-catenin, a potent transcriptional activator of Wnt signaling. In fact, we have recently shown a crosstalk between PPARgamma and beta-catenin signaling. Specifically, activation of PPARgamma induces the degradation of beta-catenin during preadipocyte differentiation by mechanisms that require GSK3beta and the proteasome. In contrast, expression of a GSK3beta-phosphorylation-defective beta-catenin renders beta-catenin resistant to the degradatory action of PPARgamma. Interestingly, expression of the mutant beta-catenin blocks expression of adiponectin and C/EBPalpha in response to the activation of PPARgamma.
