A 46,X,+mar karyotype was detected in an 11-year-old male with a clinical picture characterized by obesity, short stature, bilateral cryptorchidism and coarctation of the aorta. The presence of ZFY and SRY genes was demonstrated by PCR amplification, and the origin of the marker chromosome from a deleted Y chromosome was analyzed by in situ hybridization. The proximal limits of a deletion in Yq were defined by the absence of Southern blot hybridization signals upon probing with Yq11 markers. Cytogenetics and molecular methods taken together indicate a deletion in q11.21. In addition, the loss of Yp subtelomeric sequences was suggested by the analysis of Southern blots hybridized with a 29A24 (DXYS14) probe and by the presence of coarctation of the aorta tentatively localized in Yp. The karyotype of the patient was suggested to be: 46,X,del (Y) (p11.3-q11.21).
