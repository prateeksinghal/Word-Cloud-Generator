Twin studies, adoption studies, and studies of familial aggregation indicate that obesity has a genetic component. Whereas, the genetic factors predisposing to obesity have been elucidated for several rare syndromes, the factors responsible for obesity in the general population have remained elusive. Genetic studies of complex traits are often accelerated by the use of candidate genes. To facilitate genetic studies of human obesity, seven multiplex panels of candidate genes for obesity that are suitable for fluorescent genotyping have been assembled. The multiplex panels are composed of 66 microsatellite markers linked tightly to 16 human gene products that are of potential importance in the control of body weight or linked to syndromic forms of obesity. As part of these efforts 12 previously cloned genes have been placed on the human physical map. In addition the chromosomal location of three of these genes, ART, NYP Y6R, and PPARgamma, are reported for the first time. These resources will be of use in studies to identify the genetic factors responsible for human obesity. [Figures are available at http://www.genome.org]
