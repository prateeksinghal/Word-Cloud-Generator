Five genes have been identified, each capable of causing obesity in mice and each with a human homologue. One of them codes for a signal expressed by adipose tissue, and another for the signal's brain receptor. The rest reveal brain pathways probably downstream from the receptor. Together, the genes offer glimpses of an intricate system that defends adipose stores--and in some persons maintains an unhealthful set-point.
