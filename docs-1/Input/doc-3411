We assessed risk for obesity in 1743 first-degree relatives (parents and siblings) of 566 obese patients at three sites in the USA and one in Argentina. Onset of obesity prior to adulthood, and especially by age 10, significantly increased relative risk (2.14) for obesity in adult first-degree relatives. This increase in risk was consistent across four different patient samples from two different countries. Higher levels of obesity in patients were also associated with increased familial risk. Age of onset of obesity may be used to select obese adults with high genetic loading--an approach that should facilitate the identification of specific genes for human obesity. The enhanced ability to identify persons at high genetic risk for obesity provided by this study should increase the effectiveness of efforts to prevent obesity.
