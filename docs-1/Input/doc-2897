Alström syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinal pigment degeneration, neurogenic deafness, infantile obesity, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. While the disease-related gene remains unknown, studies of the genetic isolate of French Acadians provisionally locate the Alström syndrome on chromosome 2p12-13 within a 14.9-cM interval. To confirm this finding in another ethnic population and refine the candidate region we investigated by linkage analysis a consanguineous family of North African origin, in which three of seven siblings displayed all major neurological and metabolic features of Alström syndrome. Genotyping was performed on an ABI377 DNA automatic sequencer and LOD scores were obtained with the Fastlink program. Five markers previously investigated in French Acadians confirmed the involvement of the candidate region, although pairwise LOD scores were of poor significance (Zmax = 2.9). To further confirm homogeneity and refine the candidate region, 20 additional markers were investigated. Haplotype analysis and allele segregation revealed that affected children shared a single haplotype and were homozygous for the eight most centromeric markers (D2S291-D2S2114), over a 6.1-cM interval. Significative multipoint LOD scores (Zmax = 3.96) were obtained between markers D2S2110/145 and D2S286. Two clusters of known genes are present in this refined region of chromosome 2p, the most attractive candidate being the hexokinase II gene. However, except for several known polymorphisms, no mutations were detected in the coding region of this gene. In conclusion, the location of Alström syndrome on chromosome 2p12-13 is confirmed, reducing the genetic interval to 6.1 cM.
