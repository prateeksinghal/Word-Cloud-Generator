We report two brothers with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), obesity and short stature associated with a maternally inherited pericentric inversion (X)(p11.4q11.2). On the basis that either breakpoint might disrupt a gene whose function is critical to normal sexual development we mapped the chromosomal breakpoints using two-colour fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). The position of both the Xp11.4 and Xq11.2 breakpoints was refined using a panel of ordered BAC clones. No known genes were shown to map to the breakpoint regions. While we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that association between the clinical and cytogenetic phenotypes in the family is coincidental, it is possible that the inversion is responsible for HH through alternative molecular mechanisms such as position effects.
