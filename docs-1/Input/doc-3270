Obese (BMI &gt; or = 26 kg/m2; n = 51) and lean (BMI &lt; 26 kg/m2; n = 61) Caucasian patients with severe, familial essential hypertension, were compared with respect to genotype and allele frequencies of a HincII RFLP of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR). A similar analysis was performed in obese (n = 28) and lean (n = 68) normotensives. A significant association of the C allele of the T--&gt;C variant responsible for this RFLP was seen with obesity (chi 2 = 4.6, P = 0.029) in the hypertensive, but not in the normotensive, group (odds ratio = 3.0 for the CC genotype and 2.7 for CT). Furthermore, BMI tracked with genotypes of this allele in the hypertensives (P = 0.046). No significant genotypic relationship was apparent for plasma lipids. Significant linkage disequilibrium was, moreover, noted between the HincII RFLP and an ApaLI RFLP (chi 2 = 33, P &lt; 0.0005) that has previously shown even stronger association with obesity (odds ratio 19.6 for cases homozygous for the susceptibility allele and 15.2 for heterozygotes). The present study therefore adds to our previous evidence implicating LDLR as a locus for obesity in patients with essential hypertension.
