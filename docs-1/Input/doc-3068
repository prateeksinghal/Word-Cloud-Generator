Fatty acid binding protein 2 gene (FABP2) has been proposed to be an important candidate gene for insulin resistance; therefore, it also could be a promising candidate gene for obesity. We screened the whole coding region of the FABP2 gene in 40 obese nondiabetic Finnish subjects. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of the codon 54 polymorphism of this gene (Ala--&gt;Thr) on insulin levels and basal metabolic rate in 170 obese subjects. The frequencies of the variants found in exon 4 (GTA--&gt;GTG) and 3'-noncoding region (GCGCA--&gt;GCACA), as well as the allele frequencies for the variable lengths of the ATT repeat sequence in intron 2 did not differ between the obese subjects and nonobese controls. The frequency of threonine-encoding allele in codon 54 of the FABP2 gene did not differ between obese and control subjects (28 vs. 29%, respectively). In the obese group there were no differences in gender distribution, age, weight, body mass index, lean body mass, percentage of body fat, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio among the individuals homozygous for Ala54, heterozygous for Thr54, and homozygous for Thr54-encoding alleles. Similarly, fasting serum insulin, glucose, lipids and lipoprotein concentrations, basal metabolic rate (adjusted for lean body mass and age), respiratory quotient, and rates of glucose and lipid oxidation did not differ among the groups. We conclude that obesity is not associated with specific variants in the FABP2 gene. Furthermore, the codon 54 Ala to Thr polymorphism of this gene does not influence insulin levels or basal metabolic rate in obese Finns.
