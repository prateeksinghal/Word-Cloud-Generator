Contrary to the findings of Herbert et al. (Reports, 14 April 2006, p. 279), homozygous carriers of the C allele of the rs7566605 variant near the INSIG2 gene did not exhibit a significantly increased risk for obesity in a large population-based cross-sectional German study. A subgroup analysis, however, revealed that this allele significantly increased the risk for obesity in already overweight individuals.
