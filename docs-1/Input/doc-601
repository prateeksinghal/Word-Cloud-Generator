We present an infant girl with a de novo interstitial deletion of the chromosome 15q11-q14 region, larger than the typical deletion seen in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). She presented with features seen in PWS including hypotonia, a poor suck, feeding problems, and mild micrognathia. She also presented with features not typically seen in PWS such as preauricular ear tags, a high-arched palate, edematous feet, coarctation of the aorta, a PDA, and a bicuspid aortic valve. G-banded chromosome analysis showed a large de novo deletion of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 confirmed using FISH probes (D15511 and GABRB3). Methylation testing was abnormal and consistent with the diagnosis of PWS. Because of the large appearing deletion by karyotype analysis, an array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed. A 12.3 Mb deletion was found which involved the 15q11-q14 region containing approximately 60 protein coding genes. This rare deletion was approximately twice the size of the typical deletion seen in PWS and involved the proximal breakpoint BP1 and the distal breakpoint was located in the 15q14 band between previously recognized breakpoints BP5 and BP6. The deletion extended slightly distal to the AVEN gene including the neighboring CHRM5 gene. There is no evidence that the genes in the 15q14 band are imprinted; therefore, their potential contribution in this patient's expanded PWS phenotype must be a consequence of dosage sensitivity of the genes or due to altered expression of intact neighboring genes from a position effect.
