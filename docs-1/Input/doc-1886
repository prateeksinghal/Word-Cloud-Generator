Polymorphisms of leptin receptor (LEPR) may contribute to a common form of obesity and, as a consequence, obesity-related diseases. We evaluated the potential role of genetic variation at the LEPR gene in heart sympathetic activity and other traits related to obesity in Mexican adolescents. Adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years, with steady body weight for the last 3 months were included. We evaluated anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, seric glucose, insulin, leptin levels, heart sympathetic activity (by electrocardiograph monitoring at rest), and the Gln223Arg and Pro1019Pro LEPR polymorphisms in each subject. In total, 103 adolescents (55 obese and 48 nonobese) were included. The group of obese adolescents showed higher sympathetic activity, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, and leptin levels. The genotype frequencies for the two polymorphisms were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no difference in the genotype frequencies for Gln223Arg or Pro1019Pro polymorphisms between obese and nonobese adolescents. However, there was a higher prevalence of Gln223 allele among subjects with higher insulin levels (0.72 vs 0.57; P = 0.04 for adolescents with insulin levels higher and lower than 100 pmol/l, respectively). According to Gln223Arg polymorphism, those with Gln allele (Gln/Gln and Gln/Arg) had higher heart sympathetic activity, body fat percentage, and leptin levels. To conclude, our results support the hypothesis that Gln223Arg polymorphism of LEPR in Mexican adolescents is associated with haemodynamic and metabolic disturbances related to obesity.
