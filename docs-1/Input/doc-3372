The distribution of blood lipids is described and their role as cardiovascular risk factors in women is discussed. The determinants of serum cholesterol levels are identified in genes, in particular in changes of codes for LDL and HDL; in habitual food intake as polyunsaturated and saturated fats. Obesity, jointed by atherogenic lipoproteins as total and LDL-cholesterol, is considered a risk factor independently on smoking habit or age. Finally the role of menopause in changing lipoprotein levels and in increasing cardiovascular risk is reported.
