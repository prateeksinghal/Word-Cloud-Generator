Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease with a strong genetic component that is very prevalent in the world. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of a set of six obesity-related genes with the different disease phases of T2DM in a model using middle or aged cynomogus monkeys. A total of 25 male monkeys were used and fed with high-fat diet (15% lard). The disease development and progression of T2DM were monitored through the levels of plasma glucose and lipid. The mRNA expression of 6 genes was evaluated using real-time PCR on monocyte isolated from monkey peripheral blood. The 2-hour plasma glucose levels followed oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were (11.06+/-6.05) mmol/L and (13.12+/-2.89) mmol/L respectively (P&lt;0.01), and the fasting plasma glucose level was (7.58+/-1.56) mmol/L (vs controls, P&lt;0.01), indicating that we developed successful the models of pre-diabetic and diabetic disease in the cynomolgus monkey. Of the six tested genes, CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, and FTO genes were significantly up-regulated with disease progression in T2DM. We found that the expression of IGF2BP2 and FTO increased 65.92 and 4.30 folds in the developed T2DM. We conclude that the genes of CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, and FTO can be used as early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in type 2 diabetes.
