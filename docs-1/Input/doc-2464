As the white adipose tissue, especially abdominal fat is an endocrine organ secreting adipocytokines, which induce insulin resistance, hypertension, and arteriosclerotic diseases, reduction of the abdominal fat is important. But effect of the diet therapy differs in each individual, because of the difference of energy expenditure. Since the relationship between the missense mutation (Trp64Arg) of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor (beta 3-AR) gene and low energy expenditure in the obese Pima Indians was made clear, gene polymorphisms that mediate body weight are reported one after another. We also reported that one third of Japanese have the Trp64Arg mutation of beta 3-AR gene, which may produce obesity or difficulties in weight loss. Here we introduce the obesity-related genes, and report the importance of Tailor-made diet therapy based on molecular genetics to improve obesity.
