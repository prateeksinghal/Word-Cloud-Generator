The European wild boar was crossed with the domesticated Large White pig to genetically dissect phenotypic differences between these populations for growth and fat deposition. The most important effects were clustered on chromosome 4, with a single region accounting for a large part of the breed difference in growth rate, fatness, and length of the small intestine. The study is an advance in genome analyses and documents the usefulness of crosses between divergent outbred populations for the detection and characterization of quantitative trait loci. The genetic mapping of a major locus for fat deposition in the pig could have implications for understanding human obesity.
