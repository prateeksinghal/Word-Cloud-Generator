Necdin (NDN), a member of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family of proteins was first identified in mouse stem cells of embryonal carcinoma origin induced to differentiate by treatment with retinoic acid. The human gene maps to chromosome 15q11. This imprinted region is implicated in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a neurodevelopmental disorder, where NDN is one of multiple genes silenced by deletion, maternal uniparental disomy or translocation. Due to this association, much interest has focused on the role of NDN in neuronal development and differentiation. However, a considerable number of studies have identified additional functions of NDN. Taken together these studies suggest a pleiotropic protein with diverse functions some of which may be relevant to tumorigenesis. Downregulation of NDN occurs in carcinoma cell lines and primary tumors, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Our working hypothesis is that NDN is a worthy candidate for further studies with regard to a potential tumor suppressor role. In this article we outline the considerable evidence supporting the hypothesis that NDN has multiple functions, some of which indicate that it could be a tumor suppressor. The roles of NDN in key processes such as interaction with p53 and E2F-1, hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, transcriptional repression, angiogenesis, differentiation and interaction with the polycomb group gene BMI1 are discussed. Confirmation of NDN as a tumor suppressor may have implications for monitoring of PWS patients and could present a novel cancer therapeutic target.
