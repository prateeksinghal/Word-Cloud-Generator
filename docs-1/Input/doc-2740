To examine the chromatin basis of imprinting in chromosome 15q11-q13, we have investigated the status of histone acetylation of the SNURF-SNRPN locus, which is a key imprinted gene locus in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies revealed that the unmethylated CpG island of the active, paternally derived allele of SNURF-SNRPN was associated with acetylated histones, whereas the methylated maternally derived, inactive allele was specifically hypoacetylated. The body of the SNURF-SNRPN gene was associated with acetylated histones on both alleles. Furthermore, treatment of PWS cells with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) induced demethylation of the SNURF-SNRPN CpG island and restoration of gene expression on the maternal allele. The reactivation was associated with increased H4 acetylation but not with H3 acetylation at the SNURF-SNRPN CpG island. These findings indicate that (1) a significant role for histone deacetylation in gene silencing is associated with imprinting in 15q11-q13 and (2) silenced genes in PWS can be reactivated by drug treatment.
