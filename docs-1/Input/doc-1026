Classically, activated transcription by nuclear receptors (NRs) is due to a ligand-induced switch from corepressor- to coactivator-bound states. However, coactivators and corepressors recognize overlapping surfaces of liganded and unliganded NRs, respectively. Here we show that, at sufficiently high concentration, the NR corepressor (NCoR) influences the activity of the liver X receptor (LXR) even in the presence of a potent full agonist that destabilizes NCoR binding. Partial agonist ligands that less effectively dissociate NCoR from LXR are even more sensitive to NCoR levels, in a target gene-selective manner. Thus, differential recruitment of NCoR is a major determinant of partial agonism and selective LXR modulation of target genes.
