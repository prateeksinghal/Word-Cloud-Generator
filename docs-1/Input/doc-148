Accumulating evidence points to a pivotal role of the brain in the regulation of the circulatory system and energy balance. It has also been found that common civilization diseases such as depression, obesity, hypertension, myocardial infarction or heart failure are accompanied by an increase in concentration of inflammatory mediators in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid and various tissues. Recent studies have revealed that inflammatory mediators that are synthesized peripherally or in the brain may affect the nervous regulation of animal body systems. For example, it has been found that non-specific pro-inflammatory stimuli as well as treatment with several cytokines may cause depressive behavior, disturbances in energy balance and alterations in the circulatory system. On the other hand, knockout of genes for pro-inflammatory cytokines or administration of anti-inflammatory mediators may normalize the pathological changes. In the present manuscript we will review studies that imply the common neuroinflammatory pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, depression and energy balance disorders.
