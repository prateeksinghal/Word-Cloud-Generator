Pharmacologic contributions of directly agonizing glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor or antagonizing glucagon receptor (GCGR) on energy state and glucose homeostasis were assessed in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Metabolic rate and respiratory quotient (RQ), hyperglycemic clamp, stable isotope-based dynamic metabolic profiling (SiDMAP) studies of (13)C-labeled glucose during glucose tolerance test (GTT) and gene expression were assessed in cohorts of DIO mice after a single administration of GLP-1 analog [GLP-1-(23)] or anti-GCGR antibody (Ab). GLP-1-(23) and GCGR Ab similarly improved GTT. GLP-1-(23) decreased food intake and body weight trended lower. GCGR Ab modestly decreased food intake without significant effect on body weight. GLP-1-(23) and GCGR Ab decreased RQ with GLP-1, causing a greater effect. In a hyperglycemic clamp, GLP-1-(23) reduced hepatic glucose production (HGP), increased glucose infusion rate (GIR), increased glucose uptake in brown adipose tissue, and increased whole-body glucose turnover, glycolysis, and rate of glycogen synthesis. GCGR Ab slightly decreased HGP, increased GIR, and increased glucose uptake in the heart. SiDMAP showed that GLP-1-(23) and GCGR Ab increased (13)C lactate labeling from glucose, indicating that liver, muscle, and other organs were involved in the rapid disposal of glucose from plasma. GCGR Ab and GLP-1-(23) caused different changes in mRNA expression levels of glucose- and lipid metabolism-associated genes. The effect of GLP-1-(23) on energy state and glucose homeostasis was greater than GCGR Ab. Although GCGR antagonism is associated with increased circulating levels of GLP-1, most GLP-1-(23)-associated pharmacologic effects are more pronounced than GCGR Ab.
