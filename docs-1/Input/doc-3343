Childhood obesity is predictive of obesity as an adult, and individual differences in body weight relative to height (body mass index) in adults are important predictors of morbidity as well as mortality from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The observation of strong familial correlations does not ensure that genes are involved in the determination of body mass index, because individuals in families share environments as well as genes. However, several recent studies have found evidence for both additive (polygene) and nonadditive (major gene) components. A question that results from these analyses is--what gene(s) has been inherited that carries an associated risk, most likely mediated by environmental exposures, for obesity? Studies to identify genetic loci linked to familial obesity should add to our understanding of the genetic factors involved in the determination of obesity and may lead to early identification of individuals and families at high risk for the chronic disorders that are associated with obesity.
