Nesfatin-1, which originates from its precursor protein nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2), is a novel appetite-regulating molecule that might be associated with the melanocortin signalling pathway in the hypothalamus. The secreted protein appears to play an important role in metabolic control through its anorexigenic and anti-hyperglycemic effects. Therefore, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in the NUCB2 gene might influence the susceptibility for the development of obesity. In this study, we investigated the association of NUCB2 polymorphisms with the development of obesity in an extensive Caucasian population comprising 1049 obese subjects and 315 normal weight control individuals. We selected 8 tagSNPs, which after additional analysis of 6 multi-marker tests, cover most information on common genetic variation in the selected region. We found association with obesity for 3 SNPs (rs1330, rs214101 and rs757081) and 3 multi-marker tests, only when analyzing the male population separately. We subsequently performed linear regression analysis, again in the male population only, and found that several SNPs were associated with BMI, weight and fat free mass. These data indicate that polymorphisms in the NUCB2 gene could play an important role in the protection against the development of obesity in male subjects and might have an influence on energy homeostasis. Nevertheless, further research including replication of our results and elucidation of the molecular mechanism remains necessary.
