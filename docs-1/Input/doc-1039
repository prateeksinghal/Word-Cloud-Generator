Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the disturbed expression of genes from the imprinted region of 15q11-q13, but the specific contributions of individual genes remain unknown. Most paternal PWS deletions are bracketed by recurrent breakpoints BP1 or BP2 and BP3. Atypical deletions are very rare. In the present work, we describe the molecular analysis of two patients with atypical deletions using microsatellite analysis, methylation-specific MLPA, and microarray CGH. A deletion of about 2 Mb in Patient 1 started at BP2 and ended in the middle of the typically deleted region within the UBE3A gene. The deletion in Patient 2 started 1.3 Mb distal from BP2 within the C15ORF2 gene, extended over 9.5 Mb, and ended within the AVEN gene in proximal 15q14. In Patient 1 both deletion breakpoints involved repetitive regions, which precluded cloning of the junction and pointed to non-allelic homologous recombination as a possible mechanism of this rearrangement. The breakpoints in Patient 2 were sequenced, and their structure suggested non-homologous end joining as the most likely cause of this deletion. The phenotype of both patients did not depart significantly from the typical clinical picture of PWS, although some symptoms in Patient 2 were also reminiscent of the phenotype of individuals with the recently described 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome. Our findings support previous observations of relatively mild phenotypic effects resulting from deletions that extend distally from the PWS region and observations of the modest effects of different types of genetic defects on the spectrum and severity of symptoms in PWS.
