We describe two female patients mosaic for a cell line with an extra marker X chromosome in addition to a normal 46,XX cell line. To our knowledge, these cases are the first reports of females who had a cell line with a supernumerary marker X chromosome in addition to a normal cell line. They also had strikingly similar manifestations, including small hands and feet, minor facial anomalies, obesity, and mental retardation. The DNA content of the mar(X) chromosomes was investigated by fluorescent in situ hybridization using pericentromeric probes. The XIST gene, which is necessary for initiation of X-inactivation, was deleted from both marker chromosomes, suggesting that these chromosomes were not subject to inactivation. The short arm breakpoints of the mar(X)s were between the DNA markers DXS423E on Xp11.21 and UBE1 on Xp11.23. In Patient 1, mar(X) contained the androgen receptor gene and the DNA marker DXS1, both mapping to Xq11.2, whereas in Patient 2 the chromosome breakpoint was proximal to these markers. We suggest that the similar phenotypes of these patients may be due to the overexpression of genes in the common pericentromeric region of the X chromosome.
