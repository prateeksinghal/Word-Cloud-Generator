We report a case of Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl Syndrome with all five recognised features: tapetoretinal dystrophy, polydactily, obesity, mental retardation and hypogonadism. Nevertheless the correct diagnosis was delayed due to the fact, that the patient has a macular dystrophy (instead of a pigmentary retinopathy). He had an operation of the polydactily during childhood. This was not revealed at first. The case underlines the importance of an exact anamnesis of the parents.
