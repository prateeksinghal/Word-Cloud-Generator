In order to investigate whether weight loss can lead to improvement of the mononuclear cell (MNC) proinflammatory state, 21 nondiabetic obese women with mean age 34+/-2 years (mean+/-s.e.m.) and BMI 32.5+/-1.2 kg/m2 were enrolled in a 12-week caloric restriction and light exercise-based weight loss program. Ten lean women served as controls. Reverse transcription-PCR of proinflammatory cytokines and adipocytokines as well as homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were determined before and after weight reduction. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding to DNA and inhibitors of NF-kappaB (IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-beta) obtained from peripheral MNCs were measured. Overall, subjects lost a mean of 4.0+/-0.4 kg (5.0+/-0.3% of their initial body weight) (P&lt;0.01). In addition to significant reductions in BMI, fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, mean serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), migration inhibitor factor (MIF), leptin and visfatin levels decreased by 49.0, 66.6, 17.2, and 50.2%, respectively (all P&lt;0.05), while adiponectin concentrations rose by 33.9% (P&lt;0.05). The DNA binding of the transcriptionally active NF-kappaB from (p65/p50) decreased by 38.1% (P&lt;0.05). Elevated levels of mRNA of NF-kappaB related proinflammatory genes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), MIF, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), decreased significantly after weight loss. Although mRNA expression of Rel-A, p105, IkappaB-alpha, IkappaB-beta decreased significantly, their protein levels did not change after weight loss. As a group, NF-kappaB binding activity correlated with HOMA-IR (r=0.332, P=0.049) and marginally with values of BMI (r=0.308, P=0.059). In conclusion, weight loss by 5% of initial weight in nondiabetic obese women led to significant improvement in activated intranuclear NF-kappaB binding as well as several transcriptions of proinflammatory genes regulated by NF-kappaB.
