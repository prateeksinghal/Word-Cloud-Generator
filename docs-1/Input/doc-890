In the spirit of celebration associated with the 20th anniversary of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, we have seized the opportunity of taking a highly personal and not at all comprehensive 'whistle-stop tour' of a large body of evidence that, we feel, supports the following conclusions: (1) that body fat stores are regulated by biological control processes in humans as they are in lower animals; (2) that there are major inherited influences on the efficiency whereby such control processes operate in humans; (3) that the precise nature of those genetic and biological influences and how they interact with environmental factors are beginning to be understood; (4) that most of the genes discovered thus far have their principal impact on hunger, satiety and food intake; (5) that while there is understandable resistance to the notion that genes can influence a human behavior such as the habitual ingestion of food, the implications of these discoveries are essentially benign. Indeed, we hope that they may eventually lead to improved treatment for patients and, in addition, help to inculcate a more enlightened attitude to the obese with a reduction in their experience of social and economic discrimination.
