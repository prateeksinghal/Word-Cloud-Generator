The aim of this study was to investigate whether the EcoRI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 gene influences the associations described among obesity, regional adipose tissue distribution, and plasma lipoprotein levels. For this purpose, blood samples were collected from 56 healthy men for whom we had extensive measurements of regional adipose tissue distribution (both anthropometric and computed tomography-derived measurements) and data on the plasma lipoprotein-lipid profile. DNA was extracted from white blood cells, and RFLP analysis was performed. Subjects were classified into two groups on the basis of their apoB-100 EcoRI genotype: subjects homozygous for the major 11-kb allele, the 11/11 group (n = 40), and subjects carrying the minor 13-kb allele, the 13/11 group (n = 16). Subjects carrying the 13-kb allele had lower percent body fat and abdominal adipose tissue accumulation than subjects homozygous for the 11-kb allele (P &lt; .05). Although leaner, the 13/11 group did not show a more favorable plasma lipoprotein-lipid profile than the group homozygous for the 11-kb allele. In fact, after statistical control for the difference in percent body fat between the two genotype groups, the 13/11 group showed significantly higher plasma cholesterol levels (P &lt; .05) and nearly significantly higher apoB levels than the 11/11 group (P = .06). The association patterns between indices of regional adiposity and plasma cholesterol and apoB levels were also different between the two EcoRI genotype groups. Only in the 13/11 group was the abdominal visceral adipose tissue area significantly associated with these plasma variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
