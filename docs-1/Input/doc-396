Genes encoding adipokines are important functional candidates for development of obesity. In this study we screened for polymorphism 5'-flanking regions of the adiponectin (ADIPOQ), leptin (LEP) and resistin (RETN) genes in a cohort of Polish obese children and adolescents (n = 243) and a control group of non-obese adults (n = 100). Altogether 13 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and 1 InDel (insertion/deletion polymorphism) were found. Among them five polymorphisms, localized in the LEP gene, turned out to be novel, but their distribution was insufficient for association studies. We found no consistent evidence for association between obesity and the SNPs demonstrating minor allele frequency (MAF) above 0.2 (ADIPOQ: -11377C&gt;G, LEP: -2548C&gt;T, 19A&gt;G, RETN: -1300G&gt;A, -1258C&gt;T, -420C&gt;G). Comparison of polymorphisms distribution in patients and control group suggested association with ADIPOQ -11377C&gt;G (Pearson test P = 2.76 Ã— 10(-11)), however, we did not observe any effect of this polymorphism on BMI or relative BMI (RBMI) within obese patients (P = 0.41). We conclude that the tested SNPs are not useful markers of childhood and adolescence obesity in Polish population.
