The increasing prevalence of obesity and other nutrition-related chronic diseases has prompted considerable efforts to understand their pathogenesis and treatment. One experimental approach is to overexpress, inactivate, or manipulate specific genes that regulate energy metabolism and fat storage. Many such techniques are fully established, routine tools in Drosophila and C. elegans, which provide elegant models for dissecting endocrine problems and metabolic pathways.
