Although Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) has been linked to the loss of function of imprinted genes in 15q11q13, very little is known about the pathogenesis. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we have confirmed the previous observation of an abnormality of CD36 expression in cells with maternal uniparental disomy 15, obtained from a proband with mosaicism for PWS, by demonstrating reduced expression levels in blood cells from a series of non-mosaic probands with PWS. Furthermore, we have extended these observations to show that CD36 expression in a non-PWS population is inversely correlated with body mass index but that this correlation does not hold in PWS. CD36 which maps to 7q11.2 is the first gene outside the 15q11q13 region whose level of expression appears to be reduced in people with PWS. Low CD36 expression levels in PWS point to an abnormal control of lipid and glucose homeostasis which may explain the insatiable hunger in these patients.
