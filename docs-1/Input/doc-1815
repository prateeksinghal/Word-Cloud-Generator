Peptide YY (PYY) and Y2 receptor (Y2R) may be important in the central regulation of body weight and food intake. To determine whether genetic variation in PYY and/or Y2R may contribute to morbid obesity in humans, these genes were sequenced in 83 extremely obese Pima Indians (BMI &gt; or = 50 kg/m2). Sequencing of PYY identified three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the untranslated region. Sequencing of the Y2R coding region identified one missense (Ala172Thr) substitution and two silent substitutions. Eight additional SNPs in the 5' untranslated region of Y2R were identified from public databases. These SNPs were genotyped in 489 full-heritage adult Pimas (362 severely obese and 127 nondiabetic, nonobese subjects), who are not first-degree relatives, for association analysis. The PYY variants were not associated with obesity, whereas four variants from two haplotype blocks in Y2R were marginally associated (P = 0.054-0.067) with obesity. However, if the analysis was restricted to men (n = 167, 100 obese and 67 lean), the PYY variants and two SNPs in Y2R that were in complete linkage disequilibrium were significantly associated with severe obesity (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Our data suggest that the PYY-Y2R pathway may influence body weight through a sex-specific mechanism, but this finding requires confirmation in other populations.
