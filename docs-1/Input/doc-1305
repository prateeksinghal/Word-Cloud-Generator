Obesity is an alarming primary health problem and is an independent risk factor for type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension. Although the pathologic mechanisms linking obesity with these co-morbidities are most likely multifactorial, increasing evidence indicates that altered secretion of adipose-derived signaling molecules (adipokines; e.g. adiponectin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) and local inflammatory responses are contributing factors. Chemerin (RARRES2 or TIG2) is a recently discovered chemoattractant protein that serves as a ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor CMKLR1 (ChemR23 or DEZ) and has a role in adaptive and innate immunity. Here we show an unexpected, high level expression of chemerin and its cognate receptor CMKLR1 in mouse and human adipocytes. Cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes secrete chemerin protein, which triggers CMKLR1 signaling in adipocytes and other cell types and stimulates chemotaxis of CMKLR1-expressing cells. Adenoviral small hairpin RNA targeted knockdown of chemerin or CMKLR1 expression impairs differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes, reduces the expression of adipocyte genes involved in glucose and lipid homeostasis, and alters metabolic functions in mature adipocytes. We conclude that chemerin is a novel adipose-derived signaling molecule that regulates adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism.
