Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels were found to be associated with obesity, indicating that adipocytes might influence PAI-1 plasma levels. In addition, the 4G/5G promoter polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene possibly modulates PAI-1 gene transcription and, as a consequence, PAI-1 plasma levels. Metabolic parameters, diabetes complications, PAI-1 plasma levels, and PAI-1 promoter genotypes were determined and were tested for correlation in 547 Caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes. Genotyping was performed by using allele-specific PCR, and PAI-1 plasma levels were measured in 547 well-characterized subjects with type 2 diabetes. The allelic frequencies of the polymorphism (0.56 for the 4G-genotype, 0.44 for the 5G-genotype) were not different from those observed in nondiabetic controls. The PAI-1 concentration was positively associated with MI, but not with the 4G/5G polymorphism. Statistical analysis of metabolic parameters, diabetic complications, and the 4G/5G polymorphism revealed that serum fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in the 4G/4G subgroup compared with the 4G/5G and 5G/5G subgroups. The correlation between serum fibrinogen and 4G allele remained significant, even when additional variables, such as gender, age, BMI, duration of diabetes, and HbA1c, were controlled. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the PAI-1 4G/5G promoter polymorphism does not predict PAI-1 plasma levels and is not associated with common metabolic parameters besides fibrinogen levels.
