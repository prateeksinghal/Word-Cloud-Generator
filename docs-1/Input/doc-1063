Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a contiguous gene syndrome caused by the loss of function of genes situated within the 15q11-q13 region. The loss of function arises as a result of paternally derived mutations complemented by maternal imprinting. The molecular events underlying the disorder include interstitial deletions (70%), uniparental disomy (UPD) (25%), imprinting center defects (&lt;5%), and rarely chromosomal translocations (&lt;1%). The standard diagnosis of PWS is based on clinical observations and genetic investigations involving DNA methylation studies and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The absence of a paternal methylation pattern within 15q11 is sufficient for a diagnosis of PWS, and FISH analyses are used for the additional categorization of patients as either deletion or nondeletion. The main limitation of these investigations is that they neither determine the size of the molecular deletions nor permit detection of individuals with microdeletions in the PWS imprinting center that regulates imprinting in this region. We have designed and implemented a real-time PCR assay using genomic DNA and SYBR green I intercalating dye to determine the size of the chromosomal deletions in patients with PWS. This has been successfully performed on genomic DNA isolated from both peripheral blood leukocytes and buccal epithelial cells. Through this assay, the two common deletion classes in PWS were observed, and all results were 100% concordant with previous FISH assays performed on the same patients.
