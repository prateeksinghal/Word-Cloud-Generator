Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been extensively characterized in humans, with numerous reports of associations with obesity-related phenotypes as well an array of infectious, immune-mediated, and inflammatory disease phenotypes. Controlling for the multitude of environmental risk factors in human studies has been a major confounder of efforts to elucidate the role and relative contribution of TNF promoter SNPs. As part of an ongoing initiative to further genetically and phenotypically characterize the St Kitts-origin vervet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops ssp.) as an animal model of human obesity, we have conducted association analyses between TNF SNPs and previously defined obesity-related phenotypes in 265 pedigreed vervets. We report eight SNPs (-809G, -756A, -352C, -322A, +1285T, +2133T, +2362A, +2405), all contained within the same haplotype block and comprising a single haplotype, to be significantly associated with BMI, waist circumference, total plasma cholesterol (P &lt; 0.05), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (P &lt; 0.01). This study provides additional validation of the St Kitts-origin vervet model of obesity by demonstrating genetic associations analogous to that shown in humans.
