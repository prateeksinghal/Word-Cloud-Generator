The aim of the present study was to identify gene polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to obesity. A total of 5448 unrelated Japanese individuals from two independent populations were examined: subject panel A comprised 4252 individuals who visited participating hospitals; subject panel B comprised 1196 community-dwelling elderly individuals. The genotypes for 95 polymorphisms of 67 candidate genes were determined. The chi(2) test revealed that six polymorphisms were related (p&lt;0.05) to the prevalence of obesity in subject panel A; after application of Bonferroni's correction, however, only the 2677G --&gt; A/T polymorphism (rs2032582) of the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1 gene (ABCB1) was significantly associated (p=0.0003) with obesity. Subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis also revealed that the 2677G --&gt; A/T polymorphism of ABCB1 was significantly associated with obesity. For validation of this association, the 2677G --&gt; A/T polymorphism of ABCB1 was examined in subject panel B and again found to be significantly associated with obesity. Body mass index was significantly (p=0.01) greater for individuals with the variant T allele of this polymorphism than for those with the GG genotype in the combined subject panels A and B. Our results suggest that the ABCB1 genotype may prove informative for assessment of genetic risk for obesity in Japanese individuals.
