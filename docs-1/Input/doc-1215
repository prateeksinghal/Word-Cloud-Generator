Obesity, a global problem, is a multifactorial disorder. The factors are environmental, metabolic and genetic and their interaction with each other regulates the body weight. Imbalance in either of the factors may be responsible for weight gain. With advancement of research techniques in the last decade, genetic studies have been undertaken for several different causative mutations involving obesity loci on different chromosomes. Monogenic and polygenic obesity has been observed however, polygenic forms are more common. So far more than 200 genes in mouse and more than 100 genes in humans have been identified which result in phenotypes that affect body weight regulation. In spite of this knowledge, the field of obesity has still not been explored extensively. There remain a lot of lacuna regarding causes and treatment of obesity. Challenges are still there to identify the exact cause of weight gain and the use of current knowledge for development of anti-obesity drugs targeted for body weight regulation. In this review, we have explained neuropathophysiologic regulation of feeding behaviour and some aspects of obesity-genetics especially with single nucleotide polymorphism of selected candidate genes and their functional aspects mainly in monogenic obesity.
