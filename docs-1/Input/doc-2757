Following a classical candidate gene approach we have detected a C825T polymorphism in the gene GNB3 which encodes the G beta 3 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. The 825T allele causes alternative splicing of the gene and the generation of a truncated but functionally active splice variant of G beta 3 which is referred to as G beta 3s. Thus, genotyping for the C825T polymorphism is predictive for the activation of certain G proteins in humans. The 825T allele is significantly associated with an increased risk for hypertension in Caucasians, most likely &quot;low renin hypertension&quot; and it accumulates significantly in individuals with a strong family history of hypertension. Highest frequencies of the 825T allele (up to 80%) are found in old ethnicities, e.g. black Africans, African Americans, bushmen, and Australian aborigines. This suggests that enhanced G protein activation represents a thrifty genotype which might have facilitated survival in our ancestors. Frequencies of the 825T allele are significant lower in Asians (approximately 40 to 50%) and Caucasians (30%). More recent studies show that young 825T allele carriers are predisposed for obesity and this association could be confirmed across different ethnicities including young Germans, as well as Chinese and black African individuals. Thus, genotyping at the GNB3 locus represents an ideal tool for preventive medicine in that individuals at risk for obesity and hypertension can be identified early and counteract their genetic predisposition through changes in lifestyle. In individuals with borderline hypertension genotyping can facilitate the decision for medical treatment as a positive test result confirms an inherited form of hypertension.
