We report on a 42-year old male with short stature, azoospermia and a wide deletion of long arm of Y chromosome. On physical examination, the patient showed height of 149 cm (&lt; 1 degree centile) and reduced volume (3 ml) and consistency of the testes. On hormonal evaluation, he showed increased serum gonadotropins and normal serum testosterone levels though its HCG stimulated levels were limited. Serum thyroid hormones were normal. Serum GH levels in baseline evaluation as well as after GHRH and GHRH + pyridostigmine administration were normal. Serum IGF I levels were lower than normal in baseline evaluation whereas its response to the GH administration was in the normal range. The bilateral testicular biopsy showed tubular atrophy, hyalinosis, interstitial sclerosis and a histological picture of a Sertoli cell only syndrome. Moreover the patient showed arthropathy, otopathy, small chin, small mouth and truncal obesity. On genetic evaluation, the patient showed a 46,X,delY (pter--q11.1:) karyotype and loss of several DNA loci on Yq. In fact he preserved short arm SRY, centromeric DYZ3 and more proximal euchromatic region Yq loci, including DYS270, DYS271, DYS272, DYS11, DYS273, DYS274, DYS148, DYS275, and missed more distal DNA loci from DYS246 to DYZ2. These results disclosed a wide Y long arm deletion, including all hypothized Yq azoospermia loci (except for AZFa and probably for one of the RBM genes, which lie proximally to the deletion) and possibly the Y-specific growth control region (GCY), mapped between DYS11 and DYS246 loci. This deletion is responsible for the complete azoospermia of the patient and probably also for his short stature, even if other factors could be implicated in the statural impairment. It further possibly allowed to relate the GCY gene(s) to the control of GH or IGF-I receptor or post-receptor pathway, being the alteration of this gene(s) consistent with the hormonal pattern of the patient.
