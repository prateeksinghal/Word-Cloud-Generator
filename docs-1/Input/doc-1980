A dramatic increase in obesity prevalence and cardiovascular morbidity is expected for the coming years. However, with relevance to the heart, little is known about the specific contribution of obesity on associated morbidity. Consequently, global analysis of gene regulations in human heart was undertaken to monitor molecular regulations related to obesity or to obesity-related hypertension. Transcriptome analysis using cDNA arrays was performed in right appendage biopsies from obese patients (n=5), from patients with arterial hypertension with (n=5) or without obesity (n=5), and from 5 leans. All biopsies came from patients that had cardiac surgery and coronary bypass. Statistical analysis of the data revealed 2686 differentially expressed genes out of 11,500 when compared with lean tissues. Differential expression was verified by real-time PCR in 84% of 50 randomly chosen genes. Among genes encountered, 397 were specifically regulated in obese, 1,299 in non-obese hypertensive, and 355 in obese hypertensive patients, respectively, whereas an additional set of 153 genes was differentially expressed in all these situations. Ontology analysis, hierarchical clustering, and molecular pathway analysis indicated that the heart molecular picture of obesity differs clearly from that observed for obesity-related hypertension or arterial hypertension. Clearly, the Wnt pathway known to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy mechanisms, showed opposite regulation in obese heart compared with hypertensive heart and potentially prevented the development of cardiac remodeling in obese patients. All over, this work shows that uncomplicated obesity has a strong impact on cardiac gene expression, which could be considered as precursor signs for future cardiac disease and also demonstrates that obesity-related hypertension generates a heart-molecular-distinct phenotype that cannot be predicted by a simple sum of the impact of obesity and arterial hypertension on gene expression.
