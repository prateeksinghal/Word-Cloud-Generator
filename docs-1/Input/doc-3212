The human gene encoding the homolog of the mouse obese (ob) gene was isolated and partially characterized. The human ob gene consists of three exons and two introns and spans about 18 kilobase pairs (kb), encoding a 3.5-kb cDNA. A 3-kb 5'-flanking region of the gene was cloned and transient transfection assay with luciferase reporter confirmed the promoter activity in differentiated F442-A adipocytes. Potential regulatory elements are discussed in this report.
