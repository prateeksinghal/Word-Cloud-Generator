Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder caused by loss of function of genes situated within the 15q11-q13 region of chromosome 15. The disorder is characterized by central obesity, short stature, dysfunction of several hypothalamic centers. These symptoms lead to progressive metabolic, respiratory, circulatory and orthopedic complications. Because of the etiology of the disorder there is no known causal treatment. Patients should comply with dietary restrictions and behavioral modifications as it may reduce the risk of obesity related diseases. In this paper we present case of a 34-years old obese patient with PWS who was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, and whom CPAP treatment was offered.
