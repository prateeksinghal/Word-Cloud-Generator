An update of the human obesity gene map incorporating published results up to October 1997 is presented. Evidence from Mendelian disorders exhibiting obesity as a clinical feature; single-gene mutation rodent models; quantitative trait loci uncovered in human genome-wide scans and in crossbreeding experiments with mouse, rat, and pig models; association and case-control studies with candidate genes; and linkage studies with genes and other markers is reviewed. All chromosomal locations of the animal loci are converted into human genome locations based on syntenic relationships between the genomes. A complete listing of all of these loci reveals that all but chromosome Y of the 24 human chromosomes are represented. Some chromosomes show at least three putative loci related to obesity on both arms (1, 2, 6, 8, 11, and 20) and several on one chromosome arm only (3p, 4q, 5q, 7q, 12q, 13q, 15q, 15p, 22q, and Xq). Studies reporting negative association and linkage results are also listed, with the exception of the unlinked markers from genome-wide scans.
