The 825T allele of the GNB3 gene has been associated with essential hypertension and obesity in cross-sectional studies. We have therefore planned a longitudinal cohort study to assess whether the GNB3 825T allele is predictive of blood pressure increase in young subjects with grade I hypertension. We genotyped at the GNB3 825 locus 461 participants of the Hypertension and Ambulatory Recording Venetia Study (HARVEST) study (age, 18 to 45 years) at low cardiovascular risk, according to 1999 ISH/WHO criteria. The study end point was eligibility for antihypertensive medication, that is, progression to grade II hypertension during the first year of observation or office systolic blood pressure &gt; or =150 mm Hg and/or office diastolic blood pressure &gt; or =95 mm Hg in two later consecutive visits during follow-up. At baseline, there was no statistically significant difference among genotypes with respect to body mass index, blood pressure, and heart rate. During follow-up (mean, 4.7 years), 113 (51.1%) patients with CC genotype and 145 (60.4%) patients with TT/TC genotype reached the end point. According to survival analysis, the patients carrying the 825T allele had an increased risk of reaching the blood pressure end point (CI, 1.108 to 1.843; P=0.006). In young patients with grade I hypertension, the 825T allele is associated with increased risk of progression to more severe hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy. The GNB3 825T allele may be considered a genetic marker of predisposition for hypertension.
