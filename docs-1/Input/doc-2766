The transcriptional start site of the human cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor gene was determined by the Capsite Hunting method. Two sequence changes were detected, a G to T change in nucleotide -128, and an A to G change in nucleotide -81. The homozygote (T/T, G/G) was detected in 25 of 1296 individuals (1.9%) in the cohort study. This polymorphism showed a significantly higher percent body fat and higher levels of serum insulin and leptin, compared with wild type and heterozygotes. Our study provided the possibility that polymorphism in the promoter region of the CCK-A receptor gene may be one of genetic factors affecting fat deposition.
