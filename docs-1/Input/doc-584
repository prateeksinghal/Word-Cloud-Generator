Apolipoprotein A-V (apo A-V) exerts a potent triglyceride (TG)-lowering effect through enhanced intravascular TG-hydrolysis with increased uptake of TG-derived free fatty acids into muscle and adipose tissue. Genetic variants in the APOA5 gene were strongly associated with plasma TG concentrations. The aim of this study was to examine whether APOA5 genetic variation was associated with obesity. We genotyped the missense c.553 G&gt;T polymorphism (p.G185C) in the APOA5 gene in 1,085 Chinese (333 obese subjects and 752 nonobese controls). We analyzed the association between the c.553 G&gt;T polymorphism and obesity and related metabolic phenotypes. The T allele at the c.553 G&gt;T polymorphism was associated with higher plasma TG concentrations. Each additional T allele was associated with an increased TG concentration of 53.5 mg/dl (95% confidence interval (CI) 29.6-76.0, P &lt; 0.0001). However, the T allele was associated lower risk of obesity (odds ratio (OR), 0.48; 95% CI 0.32-0.73, P = 0.0004). Each additional copy of the T allele was associated with a BMI decrease of 0.73 kg/m(2) (95% CI 0.26-1.16, P = 0.002), equivalent to 2.11 kg in a person 1.7 m tall. We may then conclude that the TG-raising APOA5 genetic variant was associated with a decrease in BMI and reduced risk of obesity in the Chinese population.
