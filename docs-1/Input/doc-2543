It has been shown that a number of candidate gene loci (APOA1, APOA4, APOC3, APOB, APOE, CETP, LPL and FABP2) explain a significant, although still rather small, proportion of interindividual variability in fasting dietary responses. Other loci code for products that play a major role in lipoprotein metabolism and are prime candidate for future studies (i.e., CYP7, ABCA1, SRBI). Some of these loci also affect postprandial lipemic responses, and the interactions between genetic and dietary factors may be further modulated by body mass index. The deleterious phenotypic associations observed with some of the genotypes of candidate genes may therefore only be expressed in subjects with a high BMI. This question requires more careful research, the findings of which may contribute towards the drafting of specific dietary recommendations for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.
