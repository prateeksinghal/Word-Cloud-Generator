To evaluate whether genetic variability at the IL-6 gene (IL-6) is associated with hyperandrogenism, we studied four common polymorphisms in the IL-6 promoter (-597G--&gt;A, -572G--&gt; C, -373A(n)T(n), -174G--&gt;C) in 85 hyperandrogenic patients and 25 healthy women. We found 5 different haplotypes when considering the 3 biallelic polymorphisms at positions -597, -572, and -174 of IL-6 (relative frequencies in parentheses): GGG (0.505), AGC (0.377), GGC (0.059), GCG (0.055), and GCC (0.005). The frequencies of the GGG haplotype were 0.559 in patients and 0.320 in controls, whereas those of the AGC haplotype were 0.318 in patients and 0.580 in controls (chi(2) = 12.145; P &lt; 0.02). The -597G--&gt;A and -174G--&gt;C polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium (chi(2) = 152.220; P &lt; 0.00001), and were associated with patient or control status. -597G and -174G alleles were more frequent in patients in homozygosity or considering subjects homozygous and heterozygous for G alleles as a whole (P &lt; 0.05 for all analyses). In healthy women G alleles at -597 and -174 were associated with statistically significant higher circulating levels of IL-6 and basal cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone and a tendency (P &lt; 0.10) for higher total T concentrations compared with -597A and -174C alleles. On the contrary, neither the -572G--&gt;C nor the -373A(n)T(n) polymorphism was related to hyperandrogenism or influenced any clinical or biochemical variable. In conclusion, our present results suggest that the -597G--&gt;A and -174G--&gt;C polymorphisms in IL-6 are involved in the pathogenesis of hyperandrogenic disorders.
