The role of the obese gene in human obesity is presently unclear. Evidence for linkage of markers flanking the gene to obesity has been found in some but not all studies. We investigated transmission disequilibrium between two highly polymorphic microsatellite markers (D7S504 and D7S1875) flanking the human obese gene (OB) and extreme obesity in a study group of German children and adolescents. Due to the early onset and severity of obesity in the ob/ob mouse we hypothesized that especially children and adolescents with extreme obesity are enriched for possible mutations in the human OB. The analysis of 88 trios (index probands and both parents) for transmission disequilibrium of a haplotype which has previously been determined to be linked to extreme obesity (Reed et al., 1996) revealed a one-sided transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) p-value of 0.039. Post hoc analyses revealed one-sided TDT p-values of 0.015 for the 214 bp allele of D7S1875 (corrected p-value = 0.03) and 0.215 for the 145 bp allele of D7S504 (corrected p-value = 0.43). These findings substantiate the evidence for linkage of extreme obesity to OB.
