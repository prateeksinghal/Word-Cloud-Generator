Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) plays a central role on secretion of lipoprotein from the liver and the intestine. MTP catalyzes the transfer of triglyceride, cholesteryl ester and phosphatidylcholine between membranes and lipoproteins. In human, defect of MTP activity, result from mutations encoding the MTP large subunit, is the primary cause of abetalipoproteinemia. To investigate the association between hyperlipidemia with obese and MTP, We used Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rat, an animal model of obesity with visceral fat accumulation, hyperlipidemia. In animals, very-low density lipoprotein-triglyceride levels were elevated compared with the control rats. Hepatic mRNA levels of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase, and MTP were also elevated. These results suggest that the enhanced expression of both ACS and MTP genes associated with visceral fat accumulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia in obese animal models.
