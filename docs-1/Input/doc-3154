Identification of the OB (leptin) receptor (OBR) as the gene that is defective in diabetes (Leprdb) mice and fatty (Leprfa) rats provides an important candidate gene for the study of the genetics of human obesity. We defined the boundaries of the 18 coding exons for the long form of OBR, and sequenced the immediately adjacent intronic regions. These sequences can be used to generate reagents for genetic analysis (e.g., direct sequencing, single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis, etc.) of the possible role of OBR in the regulation of adiposity in humans. In addition, we have identified two highly polymorphic intronic microsatellites that can be scored with the polymerase chain reaction.
