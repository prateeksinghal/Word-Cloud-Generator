Glucocorticoids (GC) play an important role in physiologic and pathophysiologic adaptive responses to stress. The majority of these effects are mediated by the GC receptors (GR). GC sensitivity largely depends of the amount of available GR, and their ability to bind the GC-responsive element and/or other nuclear transcription factors, leading to modulation of the expression of GC target genes. Clinical conditions of tissue-specific GC resistance or GC hypersensitivity have been described in several diseases, such as chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, and in visceral obesity, such as metabolic syndrome. Several in vivo and in vitro methods have been described, allowing the evaluation and quantitation of GC sensitivity. The recognition of these parameters has improved our comprehension of the mechanisms involved in those diseases, with potential implications for the diagnosis and therapy of such abnormalities.
