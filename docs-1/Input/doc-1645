Homozygosity for the interleukin-6 (IL-6) g.-174G&gt;C promoter polymorphism has recently been associated with indices of overweight. Homozygous subjects were observed to have reduced energy expenditure, suggesting that lower IL-6 gene transcription, caused by the IL-6 g.-174G&gt;C promoter polymorphism, may be associated with obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of this polymorphism with long-term weight gain. For 334 normal weight (20 &lt; BMI &lt; or = 25 kg/m2) and 334 obese (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) subjects matched by age and sex originating from the population-based EPIC-Potsdam Study, recalled weight change from age 25 to study enrollment was determined, the IL-6 g.-174G&gt;C promoter polymorphism was defined, and plasma concentrations of IL-6 and C-reactive protein were measured. The IL-6 g.-174G&gt;C promoter polymorphism was significantly associated with obesity (chi2 = 7,34, p = 0.026). Odds ratios for subjects with GC and CC genotypes for obesity were 1.19 (95% CI: 0.84 to 1.68; p = 0.323) and 1.91 (95% CI: 1.19 to 3.08; p = 0.007), respectively. Recalled weight change from age 25 years to study enrollment differed significantly according to genotype (p = 0.044) and was most pronounced in subjects with the CC genotype, suggesting that the IL-6 g.-174G&gt;C promoter polymorphism is a susceptibility or modifying locus for common obesity and weight gain.
