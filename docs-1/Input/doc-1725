The cell death-inducing DFFA (DNA fragmentation factor-alpha)-like effector A (CIDEA) gene is implicated as an important regulator of body weight in mice and humans and is therefore a candidate gene for human obesity. Here, we characterize common CIDEA gene polymorphisms and investigate them for association with obesity in two independent Swedish samples; the first comprised 981 women and the second 582 men. Both samples display a large variation in BMI. The only detected coding polymorphism encodes an exon 4 V115F amino acid substitution, which is associated with BMI in both sexes (P = 0.021 for women, P = 0.023 for men, and P = 0.0015 for joint analysis). These results support a role for CIDEA alleles in human obesity. CIDEA-deficient mice display higher metabolic rate, and the gene cross-talks with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in fat cells. We hypothesize that CIDEA alleles regulate human obesity through impact on basal metabolic rate and adipocyte TNF-alpha signaling.
