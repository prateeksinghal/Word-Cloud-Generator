AMONG THE BIOLOGICAL MEDIATORS OF INSULIN RESISTANCE: two compounds released by the adipocyte are found, such as free fatty acids and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. They are incriminated in the deleterious role of visceral adiposity on the metabolic parameters. INTRA-CELL CORTISOL: Attention is also focused on the potential implication of cortisol in the genesis of metabolic syndrome, because cortisol is a potent antagonist of the effect of insulin and its presence in excess enhances visceral obesity and insulin resistance. GENETIC ASPECTS: Although no major locus has yet been identified, recent findings of several mutations or polymorphisms in genes acting in different regulation systems (adiponectin, PPARgamma2) also provide an interesting insight into the pathogenesis of this syndrome. Moreover, there is growing epidemiological evidence that intra-uterine factors could induce a so-called programming of the individual that may, at least in part, account for the difficulties encountered by the classical genetic approach.
