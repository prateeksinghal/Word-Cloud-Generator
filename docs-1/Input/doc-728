Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron metabolism, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease. Although it is produced mainly in the liver, its recently described expression in adipose tissue has been shown to be enhanced in massive obesity due to chronic low-grade inflammation. Our objective was to study the changes in hepcidin expression in adipose tissue during acute-phase reaction. We measured hepcidin mRNA expression from isolated subcutaneous and epicardial adipose tissue at the beginning and at the end of the surgery. The expression of mRNAs for hepcidin and other iron-related genes (transferrin receptor 1, divalent metal transporter 1, ferritin, ferroportin) were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Hepcidin expression significantly increased at the end of the surgery in subcutaneous but not in epicardial adipose tissue. Apart from the increased levels of cytokines, the parameters of iron metabolism showed typical inflammation-induced changes. We suggest that acute inflammatory changes could affect the regulation of hepcidin expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue and thus possibly contribute to inflammation-induced systemic changes of iron metabolism.
