The biological role(s) proposed for UCP3 in energy homeostasis have been based primarily upon amino acid sequence homology to UCP1. Spontaneous mutations of UCP3&gt; have been described in humans, but not in rodents. The functional consequences-or lack thereof-of these mutations in humans will be of great importance in elucidating the biology of this protein. The results of two such studies are summarized here.
