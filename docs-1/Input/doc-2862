It is now believed that the GLUT-4 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), essential fatty acids (EFAs) and their metabolites and daf-genes have an important role in the development of obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The protein encoded by daf-2 is 35% identical to the human insulin receptor, daf-7 codes a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) type signal and daf-16 can enhance superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression. EFAs and their metabolites can alter the cell membrane fluidity and enhance the expression of GLUT-4 and insulin receptors. EFAs can suppress TNF-alpha production and secretion, a mechanism that may have relevance to the role of these fatty acids in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, obesity and NIDDM. Melatonin has anti-oxidant actions similar to daf-16, TGF-beta and SOD. Based on this evidence, it is proposed that GLUT-4, TNF-alpha, EFAs, daf-genes, melatonin and leptin interact with each other in ways which may have relevance to the development or abrogation of insulin resistance, obesity, NIDDM, complications due to NIDDM, longevity and ageing.
