In the absence of a complete and annotated bovine genome sequence, detailed human-bovine comparative maps are one of the most effective tools for identification of positional candidate genes contributing to quantitative trait loci (QTL) in cattle. In the present study, eight genes from human chromosome 8 were selected for mapping in cattle to improve breakpoint resolution and confirm gene order on the comparative map near the 40 cM region of the BTA27 linkage map where a QTL affecting dairy form had previously been identified. The resulting map identified ADRB3 as a positional candidate gene for the QTL contributing to the dairy form trait based on its estimated position between 40 and 45 cM on the linkage map. It is also a functional candidate gene due to its role in fat metabolism, and polymorphisms in the ADRB3 gene associated with obesity and metabolic disease in humans, as well as, carcass fat in sheep. Further studies are underway to investigate the existence of polymorphisms in the bovine ADRB3 gene and their association with traits related to fat deposition in cattle.
