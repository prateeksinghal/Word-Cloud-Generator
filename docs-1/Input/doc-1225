Obesity has become an increasingly prevalent public health problem and results of the complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The study of rare syndromic forms of obesity enables progress in identifying molecular and physiological mechanisms, underlying the development of adiposity, food intake and energy expenditure. The identified role of the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin pathway as major in monogenic forms of obesity, has led to the recognition of new genes controlling energy homeostasis and new pharmacological targets.
