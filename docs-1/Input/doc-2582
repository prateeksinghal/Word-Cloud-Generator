The hypothalamus is a major regulatory centre involved in the control of many important physiological axes. One of these axes is the regulation of ingestive behaviour. Recent work using a combination of genetic-mutant mouse models together with targeted gene deletions has contributed much to our understanding of how neural pathways of the hypothalamus are involved in the regulation of energy balance in animals. These pathways are also relevant to human energy homeostasis. as mutations in key genes are correlated with obesity. Many of the genes identified mediate the effects of leptin, and are therefore primarily involved in sensing and responding to peripheral signals. In seasonal animals, such as the Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus), there is evidence for a higher level of regulation. The systems involved regulate body weight around an apparent 'set-point' through the action of photoperiod via the neurohormone, melatonin. The ability to manipulate energy balance through photoperiod (and melatonin) in the seasonal-animal model offers novel opportunities to identify further fundamental aspects of the control mechanisms involved in the central control of energy homeostasis and body weight.
