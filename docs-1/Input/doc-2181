Fifty-six young central obese patients were investigated to evaluate relationships between soluble E-selectin (sE-S), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism, left ventricular function and structure, and carotid morphology by determination of sE-S and ACE genotypes. Our results indicated that central obese subjects with concomitant higher levels of sE-S and ACE DD genotype may be characterized by early cardiovascular alterations and then considered a particular subset of subjects at higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
