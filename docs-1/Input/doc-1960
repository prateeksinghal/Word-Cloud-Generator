During the last years various studies have been able to offer an insight into the regulation of appetite, satiety and energy balance, as well as adipocyte differentiation and the role of adipose tissue as an endocrine organ. These mechanisms add new aspects to the pathogenesis of obesity, but also to the development of weight-reducing medications. Life-style factors, including reduced physical exercise and a high calorie intake, are responsible for the increase in obesity in industrialized countries. As a result of twin and adoption studies, the genetic influence on the development of obesity is estimated to be 30-70%. As regards the common form of obesity, more than 70 gene loci have been described as possible candidate genes. These comprise genes involved in central nervous regulation systems, including leptin, the leptinreceptor, POMC, MCR-4, as well as energy expenditure and adipocyte differentiation such as beta-adrenergic receptors, UCPs, and the nuclear receptor PPARy. The common form of obesity seems to be mainly due to an interaction between genetic disposition and environmental factors.
