Male and female preadolescents and adolescents who participated in phase 1 of the Qu√©bec Family Study, and who were retested about 12 yr later, were recruited and subdivided on the basis of a genetic variant within the intron 2 of the glucocorticoid receptor (GRL IVS2-BclI). The increase in sc adiposity over the 12-yr follow-up period in the 4.5/2.3 genotype female subgroup was more than twice that observed in the 4.5/4.5 and the 2.3/2.3 genotype subgroups (P &lt; 0.01). The statistical significance of this difference was essentially unchanged after adjusting for changes, over time, in percent dietary energy as fat, alcohol consumption, and participation in vigorous physical activity. In male subjects, the same trend was found, but it did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, this study suggests that a significant interaction effect exists between variation in the glucocorticoid receptor gene and body fat gain in female subjects experiencing the transition between adolescence and adulthood. Further research will, however, be necessary to characterize the lifestyle factors promoting fat accumulation, over time, among genetically susceptible individuals.
