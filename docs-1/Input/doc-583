Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb. (Compositae) (ASL) is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat different hepatic diseases. However, a hypolipidemic effect of ASL on fatty liver disease has not been reported. Therefore, we investigated whether 95% ethanol eluate (EE), an active part of ASL, would attenuate hepatic lipid accumulation in human HepG2 cells by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Significant decreases in triglyceride levels and increases in AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation were observed when the cells were treated with 95% EE. EE down-regulated the lipogenesis gene expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and its target genes, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the lipolytic gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha) and CD36 increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These effects were abolished by pretreatment with compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. However, there were no differences in the gene expression of SREBP2, low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), hydroxymethyl glutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA), or glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). At the same time, 95% EE significantly increased the gene expression of acyl CoA oxidase (ACOX) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Thus, AMPK mediated 95% EE induced suppression of SREBP1c and activation of PPAR-alpha respectively. These finding indicate that 95% EE attenuates hepatic lipid accumulation through AMPK activation and may be active in the prevention of serious diseases such as fatty liver, obesity, and type-2 diabetic mellitus.
