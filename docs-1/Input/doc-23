Asymptomatic hyperuricemia affects one in five adults in the general population and is associated with elevated cardiovascular risk. It is however not clear whether asymptomatic hyperuricemia is a cause or simply a marker of conditions associated with high cardiovascular risk. Sex, age, obesity, renal function and selected drugs are major determinants of serum uric acid. Moreover, recent genome-wide association studies have identified new genes involved in the control of serum uric acid levels, in particular SLC2A9, which encodes a urate transporter located in the kidney. A genetic score based on several genetic variants associated with serum uric acid is strongly associated with the risk of gout, but not with cardiovascular events so far.
