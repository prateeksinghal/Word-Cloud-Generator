Paternally expressed 1 (Peg1)/mesoderm specific transcript (Mest) is an imprinted gene, which is only transcribed from the paternal (father's) allele. In some human cancer tissues, an alternatively spliced variant of PEG1/MEST mRNA using a different promoter of a distinct first exon is expressed from both paternal and maternal alleles. We previously reported that Peg1/Mest expression was markedly up-regulated in obese adipose tissue in mice. Moreover, transgenic overexpression of Peg1/Mest in the adipose tissue resulted in the enlargement of adipocytes in size. Given the potential pathophysiologic relevance in obesity, we examined the nature of increased expression of Peg1/Mest in obese adipose tissue. In obese adipose tissue, expression of Peg1/Mest was increased, but not that of other imprinted genes tested. The transcription rate of Peg1/Mest was increased in obese adipose tissue. We found at least four isoforms of mouse Peg1/Mest generated by use of the alternative first exons. We also demonstrated that the abundantly expressed Peg1/Mest in obese adipose tissue retained monoallelic expression. This is the first report of monoallelic induction of Peg1/Mest in adult tissues.
