Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex human genetic disease that arises from lack of expression of paternally inherited imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. Identification of the imprinting control centre, novel imprinted genes and distinct phenotypes in PWS patients and mouse models has increased interest in this human obesity syndrome. In this review I focus on: (i) the chromosomal region and candidate genes associated with PWS, and the possible links with individual PWS phenotypes identified using mouse models; (ii) the metabolic and hormonal phenotypes in PWS; (iii) postmortem studies of human PWS hypothalami; and (iv) current and potential advances in the management of PWS and its complications. This could have benefits for a wide spectrum of endocrine, paediatric and neuropsychiatric diseases.
