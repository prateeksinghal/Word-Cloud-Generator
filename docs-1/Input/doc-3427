Here we describe a 12-year-old boy with finger and toe contractures, obesity, mental retardation, osteoporosis, and genital anomalies. This clinical picture was first described by Urban et al. [1979] and has been designated as &quot;Prader-Willi habitus, osteoporosis, and hand contractures.&quot; To our knowledge, our patient represents the second report of this condition.
