There is evidence that the obesity phenotype in the Caucasian populations is associated with variations in several genes, including neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1), SEC16 homolog B (SCE16B), transmembrane protein 18 (TMEM18), ets variant 5 (ETV5), glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2 (GNPDA2), prolactin (PRL), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2), Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2), SH2B adaptor protein 1 (SH2B1), v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (MAF), Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1), melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and potassium channel tetramerisation domain containing 15 (KCTD15). To investigate the relationship between obesity and these genes in the Japanese population, we genotyped 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 genes from obese subjects (n=1129, body mass index (BMI) &gt; or =30 kg m(-2)) and normal-weight control subjects (n=1736, BMI &lt;25 kg m(-2)). The SNP rs10913469 in SEC16B (P=0.000012) and four SNPs (rs2867125, rs6548238, rs4854344 and rs7561317) in the TMEM18 gene (P=0.00015), all of which were in almost absolute linkage disequilibrium, were significantly associated with obesity in the Japanese population. SNPs in GNPDA2, BDNF, FAIM2 and MC4R genes were marginally associated with obesity (P&lt;0.05). Our data suggest that some SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies in the Caucasians also confer susceptibility to obesity in Japanese subjects.
