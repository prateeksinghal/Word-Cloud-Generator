Several polymorphisms in apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) gene have been associated with metabolic diseases. Increased transcription efficiency was observed in -75A allele carriers compared to -75G allele homozygotes. +83C allele was associated with higher body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio in type II diabetes subjects. -75G/A and +83C/T polymorphisms were analyzed by RFLP-PCR in 334 individuals from a Brazilian elderly cohort. APOA1 polymorphisms were associated with age-related morbidities, as well as with triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, VLDL, LDL, creatinine, urea, albumin, glycated hemoglobin and fasting glucose serum levels. Allele frequencies were 0.102 and 0.21, respectively, for -75A and +83T. -75G allele showed significant association with hypertension (P = 0.001). An association between +83C allele and obesity was observed (P = 0.040) and this allele also showed an association with hypertension in the presence of cardiovascular disease (P = 0.047). Moreover, +83T allele was associated with lower glycated hemoglobin values (P = 0.026). To our knowledge, there is no data associating this polymorphism with glycated hemoglobin. Furthermore, individuals carrying AT haplotype have lower risk for developing hypertension (P = 0.0002), while GT haplotype carriers present decreased risk to develop obesity comparing to GC haplotype (P = 0.025). APOA1 polymorphisms analysis may be a useful tool to identify risk factors for subjects and families and clarify the physiopathological role of these polymorphisms in age-related diseases, such as hypertension and obesity.
