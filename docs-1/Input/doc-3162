IPW (Imprinted gene in the Prader-Willi syndrome region) is a recently identified paternally expressed gene. Previous work has demonstrated IPW expression in the human fetus and adult, with monoallelic expression in adult lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, and in fetal tissues. To further examine the expression of IPW, a series of experiments were carried out using RT-PCR to measure IPW expression in placentae and various fetal and tumor tissues. Biallelic expression of IPW was found in testicular germ cell tumor and bladder cancer cells, suggesting loss of imprinting in the latter case. Both H19 and Insulin-like growth Factor 2 (IGF2), two additional imprinted genes, also showed biallelic expression in those same tumors that demonstrated IPW biallelic expression. Of note, the naturally occurring parthenogenetic-derived mature teratoma unexpectedly expressed large amounts of IPW. Lastly, the pluripotent embryonal cancer cell line Tera-2 expressed IPW at the same level before and after differentiation induced by retinoic acid, suggesting that this gene functions in a 'housekeeping' capacity throughout cell growth. This was in contradistinction to H19 and IGF2, both of which showed significant transcriptional upregulation after Tera-2 cell differentiation.
