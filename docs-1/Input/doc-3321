Several recent studies of the body mass index (BMI) have provided support for a recessive major gene influencing heaviness in humans. Segregation analysis of the BMI was carried out recently in a series of randomly sampled French-Canadian families to determine whether we could replicate the major gene finding by using a residual phenotype adjusted for the effects of age and sex. The best model included a recessive major effect for high BMI values with residual familial resemblance; however, Mendelian transmission could not be confirmed, and the no-transmission hypothesis (where all the tau's are constrained to be equal) was not rejected. Considering that the BMI is a complex phenotype affected by many factors and that there are known variations in body composition during growth and aging, we undertook a reanalysis of the data, using a model that allowed the estimation of genotype-specific age and gender effects. New tests on the transmission parameters satisfy the criteria for interfering Mendelian segregation. The results suggest that individuals with the &quot;high&quot; recessive genotype show the greatest degree of heaviness at birth, with a subsequent trend toward lower values throughout life, while individuals with the dominant &quot;normal&quot; genotypes show no appreciable trends with age. In addition, the &quot;high&quot; genotype appears to confer a greater degree of heaviness in females as compared with males. These results, along with other observations from the data, suggest that, while a recessive single gene influence may be discernible, the phenotypic expression of the BMI is likely to be complicated by genotype x environment interactions and, possibly, by the action of other loci. Further, the data also are consistent with the hypothesis that modifying factors may include the adoption of a more prudent life-style by individuals genetically predisposed to heaviness and a secular increase in the incidence, prevalence, and potency of environmentally based triggers leading to a higher penetrance of the &quot;heavy&quot; genotype in the young.
