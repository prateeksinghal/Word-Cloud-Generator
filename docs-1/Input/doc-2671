The insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) is a major insulin signalling molecule. IRS-2 inactivation in mice induces a form of diabetes characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and reduced beta cell mass. We tested the hypothesis that a common non-conservative amino acid substitution of IRS-2 (G1057D) might interact with overweight in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The variant was genotyped in 193 Italian patients with type 2 diabetes and 206 control subjects. In the absence of overweight, the risk of type 2 diabetes decreased according to the dosage of the D1057 allele (odds ratio for GD genotype 0.46 [95% CI 0.25-0.86]; DD genotype 0.18 [0.04-0.68]; P for trend = 0.0012). Conversely, the interaction between overweight and genotype increased the risk of type 2 diabetes according to the dosage of the D1057 allele (odds ratio for GD genotype 2.50 [1.11-5.65]; DD genotype 5.74 [1.11-29. 78]; P for trend = 0.0047). Among controls, fasting C-peptide levels, after adjustment for plasma glucose, were inversely related to the dosage of the D1057 allele (P = 0.020). This finding suggested that carriers of the D1057 allele may have higher insulin sensitivity and supported the protective effect of this allele. Conversely, among overweight patients there was a parallel increase in fasting plasma glucose (P for trend = 0.037) and fasting C-peptide according to the dosage of the D1057 allele, suggesting that higher insulin resistance and relative beta cell failure contributed to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes in overweight carriers of this allele. These data provide evidence for a strong association between type 2 diabetes and the G1057D common genetic variant of IRS-2, which appears to be protective against type 2 diabetes in a codominant fashion. Overweight appears to modify the effect of this polymorphism toward a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Carriers of this polymorphism may represent an elective target for prevention of type 2 diabetes through preventing or treating excessive weight.
