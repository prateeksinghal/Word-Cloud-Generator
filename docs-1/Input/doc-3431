To learn about adipose differentiation of precursors from postnatal adipose tissue of lean and massively obese subjects, human omental adipocyte precursor-murine renal adenocarcinoma cell (RAG) hybrids were formed by fusion with polyethylene glycol, and cultured selectively with 50 microM ouabain in hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine (HAT) medium. Under conditions in which the parent cells did not differentiate, a number of hybrids, which were cloned, revealed morphologic and biochemical evidence of differentiation. In addition to activation of human genes within the common nucleus of the hybrids, murine cytoplasmic activators are probably also involved because heterocaryons (fused cells with two interspecific nuclei) revealed the same phenomenon. Hybrids composed of precursors from massively obese subjects disclosed more frequent and prominent differentiation. Since these hybrids, in contrast to those from the lean, recapitulate this phenomenon in subcultures, they provide the potential system for mapping the human gene(s) responsible for adipose differentiation and its exaggeration in massive obesity.
