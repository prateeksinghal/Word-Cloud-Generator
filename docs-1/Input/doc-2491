PPAR gamma is a major determinants of adipocyte differentiation and its activation by ligands including thiazolidinedione(TZDs) and the endogenous ligands induces transcription of the genes involving glucose and lipid metabolism. By the experiments using animal models with obesity-related phenotypes and PPAR gamma knockout mouse and the results of genetics study regarding on the mutations and SNPs in human, it is postulated that the PPAR gamma activation determines and modifies insulin sensitivity by the relationship between the degree of the activation and potency of ligands(agonists/antagonists). The modulation of the PPAR gamma activation by synthetic agonist/antagonists will be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity-related phenotypes.
