Acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta, encoded by the ACAB gene, plays an important role in the oxidation of fatty acids. The aim of this study was to check the hypothesis that allelic variants of ACACB influence the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Twenty five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) capturing common variants of the ACACB gene were selected and analyzed in two cohorts including 1695 postmenopausal women of the general population and in 161 women with severe obesity (BMI&gt;35). In vitro binding of transcription factors was explored by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). T alleles at the rs2268388 locus were overrepresented in women with severe obesity (18% vs. 10% in controls; OR 1.74 [95% confidence interval 1.30-2.47]), which was statistically significant after multiple-test adjustment (p=0.0004). Likewise, T alleles at the rs2268388 locus and C alleles at the rs2239607 locus were associated with diabetes, in the discovery as well as in the replication cohorts, even after women with severe obesity were excluded (OR 3.6 and 2.8, for TT and CC homozygotes, respectively). Allelic differences in the binding affinity for nuclear proteins were revealed in vitro by EMSA and competition experiments were consistent with the binding of glucorticoid receptor and serum response factor. In conclusion, common polymorphisms of ACACB gene are associated with obesity and, independently, with type 2 diabetes in postmenopausal women, suggesting that the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta plays an important role in these disorders related to energy metabolism.
