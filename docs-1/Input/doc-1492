The purpose of the present study was to identify gene polymorphisms for the reliable assessment of genetic factors for obesity. The study population comprised 3906 unrelated Japanese individuals (2286 men, 1620 women), including 1196 subjects (677 men, 519 women) with obesity (body mass index of &gt; or = 25 kg/m2) and 2710 controls (1609 men, 1101 women). The genotypes for 147 polymorphisms of 124 candidate genes were determined with a method that combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, and the prevalence of smoking revealed that the -30Gright curved arrow A polymorphism of GCK, the -240Aright curved arrow T polymorphism of ACE, and the -482Cright curved arrow T polymorphism of APOC3 were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) associated with the prevalence of obesity, and the -1989Tright curved arrow G polymorphism of ESR1 was almost significantly associated. A stepwise forward selection procedure demonstrated that ACE, GCK, and ESR1 genotypes significantly (P &lt; 0.01) and independently affected the prevalence of obesity. Combined genotype analysis for these three polymorphisms yielded a lowest odds ratio of 0.45 for the combined genotypes of AT or TT for ACE, GG for GCK, and GG for ESR1 in comparison with the combined genotypes of AA for ACE, GG for GCK, and TT or TG for ESR1. Genotypes for ACE, GCK, and ESR1 may prove reliable for the assessment of genetic factors for obesity. Determination of the combined genotypes for these genes may contribute to the personalized prevention of this condition.
