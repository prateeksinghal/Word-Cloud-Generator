Stroke is a common neurologic disorder associated with comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus. Smoking or being the first-degree relative of a stroke patient can independently almost double the risk of ischemic stroke, supporting the hypothesis that stroke results from an intricate interplay between genes and the environment. Several candidate genes have been nominated but not confirmed as influencing stroke susceptibility and phenotype. A number of genes involved in monogenic forms of disease have been identified as causative in familial stroke. Herein we discuss these genes and the potential role of genetics in the more common sporadic form of stroke and therapeutic intervention strategies.
