The study subjects were 192 overweight and obese Thais (BMI &gt; 25.00 kg/m2), and 103 Thai controls (BMI = 18.50-24.99 kg/m2), whose ages ranged from 18-60 years. All subjects were evaluated for serum Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), globulin, albumin concentration, and polymorphic variation in the A2M gene. Serum A2M and albumin were significantly lower in the overweight/obese group (P &lt; 0.05). For the overweight/obese and control group, the median ages were 38 and 37 years, serum A2M 200.2; 252.0 (mg/L), albumin 4.4; 4.5 (g/dL), and globulin 3.0; 2.95 (g/dL), respectively. A2M deletion polymorphism genotyping showed no association between A2M deletion polymorphism and the two groupings. At serum A2M concentration &lt; 250 mg/L, there was no relationship between A2M deletion polymorphism and age. Serum A2M had a significant negative correlation with age in all subjects (R = 0.09, P &lt; 0.05). The results did not support the hypothesis that A2M deletion polymorphism is associated with a low A2M concentration in overweight/obese subjects. However, serum A2M had a significant negative correlation with age; serum A2M can possibly be used to indicate the aging of cells in vivo, including the brain. Further studies are needed to investigate other A2M genes located on chromosome 12 to prove A2M gene polymorphism's association with low serum A2M and aging.
