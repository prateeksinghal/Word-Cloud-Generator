APOA5 is one of the strongest regulators of plasma TG concentrations; nevertheless, its mechanisms of action are poorly characterized. Genetic variability at the APOA5 locus has also been associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk; however, this predisposition could be attenuated in the context of a prudent diet as traditionally consumed in the Mediterranean countries. We have investigated the interaction between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the APOA5 gene (-1131T &gt; C) and dietary fat that may modulate TG-rich lipoprotein concentrations and anthropometric measures in overweight and obese participants. We recruited 1465 participants from a Spanish population (20-65 y old; BMI 25-40 kg/m(2)) attending outpatient obesity clinics. Consistent with previous reports, we found an association between the APOA5-1131T &gt; C SNP and TG-rich lipoprotein concentrations that were higher in carriers of the minor allele than in noncarriers (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, we found a significant genotype-dietary fat interaction for obesity traits. Participants homozygous for the -1131T major allele had a positive association between fat intake and obesity, whereas in those carrying the APOA5-1131C minor allele, higher fat intakes were not associated with higher BMI. Likewise, we found genotype-dietary fat interactions for TG-rich lipoproteins (P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, we have replicated previous gene-diet interactions between APOA5 -1131T &gt; C SNP and fat intake for obesity traits and detected a novel interaction for TG-rich lipoprotein concentrations. Our data support the hypothesis that the minor C-allele may protect those consuming a high-fat diet from obesity and elevated concentrations of TG-rich lipoproteins.
