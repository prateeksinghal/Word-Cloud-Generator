We present the knowledge acquired in the field of the genetics of human obesity. The molecular approach proved to be powerful to define new syndromes associated to obesity. The pivotal role of leptin and melanocortin pathways were recognized but in rare obesity cases. In the commoner form of obesities, a multitude of polymorphisms located in genes and candidate regions participate in an individual susceptibility to weight gain in a permissive environment. The effects are often uncertain and the results not always confirmed. It is now necessary to integrate data of various origins (environment, genotype, expression) to clarify the domain.
