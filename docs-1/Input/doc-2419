Recent studies have reported a genetic association between the -1438 G/A polymorphism within the promoter region of the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene and eating disorders (ED), with conflicting results. To clarify the role of the -1438 G/A polymorphism in different ED categories we have analyzed the genotype and allele frequency distribution in 54 Italian patients with Binge ED (BED) compared to 132 obese non-BED subjects. No significant differences were found between obese BED and obese non-BED individuals, suggesting that this polymorphism does not genetically distinguish these two phenotypes. Moreover, the evaluation of 148 patients with anorexia nervosa and 86 patients with bulimia nervosa revealed an association of the A allele with both these disorders.
