A previous report describes that neuropeptide Y (NPY)/NPY2 receptor (NPY2R) is involved in stress-induced visceral obesity. This is a report clarifying the effect on metabolic parameters of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5'-flanking region of NPY2R gene. Study participants are 317 people (98 men and 219 women, 40-79 years old) undergoing health checkups. The single nucleotide polymorphism typing of rs6857715 and rs6857530 located on the 5'-flanking region of the NPY2R gene was performed using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction method. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level was significantly lower in men possessing rs6857715 TT genotype compared with CC and in men possessing rs6857530 GG genotype compared with AA. No significant difference was observed between each genotype and other metabolic parameters including body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and fasting plasma glucose. The variation in the 5'-flanking region of the NPY2R gene was associated with serum HDL-C level in men and was a predictor for serum HDL-C level independent of sex and serum triglyceride level.
