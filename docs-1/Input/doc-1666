Obesity is a multifactorial disorder with a complex phenotype. It is a significant risk factor for diabetes and hypertension. We assessed obesity-related traits in a large cohort of twins and performed a genome-wide linkage scan and positional candidate analysis to identify genes that play a role in regulating fat mass and distribution in women. Dizygous female twin pairs from 1,094 pedigrees were studied (mean age 47.0+/-11.5 years (range 18-79 years)). Nonparametric multipoint linkage analyses showed linkage for central fat mass to 12q24 (141 cM) with LOD 2.2 and body mass index to 8q11 (67 cM) with LOD 1.3, supporting previously established linkage data. Novel areas of suggestive linkage were for total fat percentage at 6q12 (LOD 2.4) and for total lean mass at 2q37 (LOD 2.4). Data from follow-up fine mapping in an expanded cohort of 1243 twin pairs reinforced the linkage for central fat mass to 12q24 (LOD 2.6; 143 cM) and narrowed the -1 LOD support interval to 22 cM. In all, 45 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 26 positional candidate genes within the 12q24 interval were then tested for association in a cohort of 1102 twins. Single-point Monks-Kaplan analysis provided evidence of association between central fat mass and SNPs in two genes - PLA2G1B (P = 0.0067) and P2RX4 (P = 0.017). These data provide replication and refinement of the 12q24 obesity locus and suggest that genes involved in phospholipase and purinoreceptor pathways may regulate fat accumulation and distribution.
