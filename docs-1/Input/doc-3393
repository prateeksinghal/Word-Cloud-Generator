Parallel with biochemical and physiological research into functional disturbances possibly leading to obesity, the focus of genetic and epidemiological research has been the aetiology of obesity. There is no longer any doubt that there are both genetic and environmental causes. Polygenic factors, and possibly recessive monogenic inheritance would seem to be involved. Aggregation of environmental factors at the family level may be decisive so long as the family members still live together, but other environmental factors are equally important. It will be the task of future research to identify the genes and environmental factors involved, thus providing a rational basis for effective prophylaxis.
