To elucidate the biological characteristics of adipose tissue, we analyzed the gene expression profile of visceral and subcutaneous fat. Unexpectedly, adipose tissue, especially visceral fat, expressed a variety of genes for secretory proteins. About 30% of the genes expressed in visceral adipose tissue encoded secretory proteins and most were biologically active molecules, which we called adipocytokines. We found plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and heparin binding EGF-like growth factor. Production of these atherogenic adipocytokines was shown to increase with the accumulation of visceral fat, which may be one of the mechanisms of vascular disease in visceral obesity. We found a unique and novel collagen-like protein, adiponectin, encoded by the most abundantly expressed gene in adipose tissue, termed APM1 (adipose most abundant gene transcript-1). Plasma levels of adiponectin ranged from 0.3 to approximately 3 mg/dl but were decreased in patients with visceral obesity, type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD). Screening for mutations in the adiponectin gene revealed that patients carrying a missense mutation showed markedly decreased plasma levels of adiponectin and had CAD. These data suggest that hypoadiponectinemia may be considered an important risk factor for CAD. Cell biology studies revealed that adiponectin has a potent inhibitory effect on the expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells and an inhibitory effect on the expression in macrophages. In order to confirm these antidiabetic and antiatherogenic functions of adiponectin, we developed adiponectin knockout mice. Adiponectin knockout mice showed severe insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism when fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet. Knockout mice also developed intimal thickening in response to endothelial injury.
