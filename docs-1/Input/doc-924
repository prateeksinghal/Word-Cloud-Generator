Risk of developing obesity and diabetes may be influenced by the nutritional environment early in life. We examined the effects of high fibre or protein diets on satiety hormones and genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism during postnatal development and on adult fat mass. At 21 days of age, Wistar rat pups were weaned onto control (C), high fibre (HF) or high protein (HP) diet. Tissue and blood were collected at 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days after birth. A second group of rats consumed the weaning diets until 4 months when they were switched to a high fat-high sugar diet for 6 weeks, after which body and fat mass and plasma glucose were determined. In young rats, HF diet increased plasma glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) compared to C and HP and decreased leptin compared to C at postnatal days 28 and 35. Hepatic fatty acid synthase mRNA was down-regulated by HF and HP compared to C at days 28 and 35. In brown adipose tissue, HF increased uncoupling protein-3 mRNA whereas HP increased mRNA of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6. Body weight, fat mass and glycaemia in adult males and fat mass in females were greater after the high fat challenge in rats that consumed the HP diet from weaning. Increasing fibre or protein in postnatal diets causes rapid change in satiety hormone secretion and genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism which appear to influence fat mass and glycaemia in adulthood, high protein being associated with increased susceptibility to obesity.
