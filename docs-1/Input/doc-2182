We have examined whether GLUT-10 and GLUT-12, members of the Class III group of the recently expanded family of facilitative glucose transporters, are expressed in adipose tissues. The mouse GLUT-12 gene, located on chromosome 10, comprises at least five exons and encodes a 622 amino acid protein exhibiting 83% sequence identity and 91% sequence similarity to human GLUT-12. Expression of the GLUT-12 gene was evident in all the major mouse adipose tissue depots (epididymal, perirenal, mesenteric, omental, and subcutaneous white; interscapular brown). The GLUT-10 gene is also expressed in mouse adipose tissues and as with GLUT-12 expression occurred in the mature adipocytes as well as the stromal vascular cells. 3T3-L1 adipocytes express GLUT-10, but not GLUT-12, and expression of GLUT-12 was not induced by insulin or glucose. Both GLUT-10 and GLUT-12 expression was also found in human adipose tissue (subcutaneous and omental) and SGBS adipocytes. It is concluded that white fat expresses a wide range of facilitative glucose transporters.
