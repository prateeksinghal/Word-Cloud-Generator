Studies in humans have independently identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene associated with obesity in multiple populations. It was shown that FTO participated in the regulation of energy homeostasis and associated with increased lipolytic activity in adipocytes. To ascertain whether there were mutations in the bovine FTO gene, this study investigated the variation of the FTO gene through PCR-SSCP and sequencing. Five synonymous mutations, two missense mutations, and three intronic SNPs were identified in 614 cattle from five independent populations. Haplotype frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficients of these SNPs in three Chinese indigenous cattle breeds were analyzed. Two LD blocks were found in the Qinchuan and Nanyang cattle breeds and three LD blocks were found in the Jiaxian cattle breed, suggesting the possibility of a recombination hotspot between exon 5 and intron 5 of the bovine FTO gene. The variations detected here might have an impact on the FTO gene activity and function.
