Evidence for a genetic basis for type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome has been derived from studies of families, twins and populations with genetic admixture. Identification of genes associated with disease pathogenesis is now underway using techniques such as genome scanning by positional cloning and the candidate gene approach. Genome scanning in several different ethnic groups has identified chromosome regions harbouring type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes such as the novel gene, calpain 10 (CAPN10). The hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) gene partly explains the linkage peak on chromosome 20, while the upstream transcription factor (USF1) is associated with familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCHL) and maps close to the type 2 diabetes associated 1q peak. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) was identified as a candidate gene based on its biology. A Pro12Ala variant of this gene has been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Many genes accounting for monogenic forms of diabetes have been identified--such as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY); glucokinase (GCK) and HNF1alpha mutations being the most common causes of MODY. GCK variants result in 'mild' diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and relatively few cardiovascular complications, while HNF1alpha-associated MODY is more typical of type 2 diabetes, frequently being treated with sulphonylureas or insulin and resulting in microvascular complications. Testing for single gene disorders associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity may determine cause, prognosis and appropriate treatment; however, for the more common polygenic diseases this is not the case. In type 2 diabetes, molecular genetics has the potential to enhance understanding of disease pathogenesis, and help formulate preventative and treatment strategies.
