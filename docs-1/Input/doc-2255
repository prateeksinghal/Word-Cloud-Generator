Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is an adipocyte-derived hormone that plays a key role in the control of food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin acts through receptors that belong to a member of the class I cytokine receptor family. It has been demonstrated that the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) negatively regulates STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation through long form leptin receptor (OBRb). Vanadate has been shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of PTPase activity in vitro. In this study, we have demonstrated that vanadate increases leptin-induced JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation in CHO cells expressing OBRb. The increased leptin-dependent luciferase activity of SOCS3 gene was also seen in vanadate-treated cell. Furthermore, vanadate reversed the inhibitory effects of SOCS3 on leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. The present findings suggest that PTP inhibitors including vanadate and vanadate-derived compounds could be used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of obesity.
