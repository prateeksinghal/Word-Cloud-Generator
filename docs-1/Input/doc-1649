Adipocyte dysfunction is strongly associated with the development of obesity and insulin resistance. It is accepted that the regulation of adipocytokine secretion or the adipocyte specific gene expression is one of the most important targets for the prevention of obesity and amelioration of insulin sensitivity. Recently, we demonstrated that anthocyanins, which are pigments widespread in the plant kingdom, have the potency of anti-obesity in mice and the enhancement adipocytokine secretion and its gene expression in adipocytes. In this study, we have shown the gene expression profile in human adipocytes treated with anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-glucoside; C3G or cyanidin; Cy). The human adipocytes were treated with 100 microM C3G, Cy or vehicle for 24 h. The total RNA from the adipocytes was isolated and carried out GeneChip microarray analysis. Based on the gene expression profile, we demonstrated the significant changes of adipocytokine expression (up-regulation of adiponectin and down-regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and interleukin-6). Some of lipid metabolism related genes (uncoupling protein2, acylCoA oxidase1 and perilipin) also significantly induced in both common the C3G or Cy treatment groups. These studies have provided an overview of the gene expression profiles in human adipocytes treated with anthocyanins and demonstrated that anthocyanins can regulate adipocytokine gene expression to ameliorate adipocyte function related with obesity and diabetes that merit further investigation.
