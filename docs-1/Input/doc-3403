We have conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the genetic and environmental contributions to the variance of anthropometric measurements in children during early adolescence. Univariate path analysis was used to estimate the relative contributions of genes, individual environment, and family environment to measures of childhood obesity in 259 11-y-old Caucasian twin pairs. Triceps, subcapular, and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses, as well as waist circumferences, ht, and wt were measured in a standardized protocol. In this sample, a parsimonious model that included only additive genetic effects and environmental factors unique to the individual provided an adequate explanation for the variation in ht, wt, quetelet index, and subscapular and triceps skinfolds. In this largely preadolescent population, different magnitudes of genetic effects were seen in males and females for waist circumference, biiliac diameter, and suprailiac skinfold.
