The human CCKAR gene was previously mapped to chromosome 4 using a panel of human/hamster somatic cell hybrids. We now report the cytogenetic and physical localization of the CCKAR gene. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we determined that CCKAR maps to 4p15.1-p15.2. On the physical map, CCKAR was adjacent to the marker AFMa283yh5, between AFMb355ya5 and WI-4086. A simple sequence repeat (D4S391) with high heterozygosity was found in the database, and CCKAR and this genetic marker were colocalized on two YACs (933D9 and 928A5). We also characterized the genomic structure and determined the exon-intron boundaries of the gene. This provided the opportunity to screen the gene in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and/or obesity for single nucleotide changes using a single-strand conformational polymorphism strategy. Five sequence variants were identified in the coding sequence of the gene, including two missense variants (G21R and V365I). The results of these studies provide (1) precise genetic and physical mapping data, (2) exon-intron sequences for single nucleotide analysis, and (3) identification of two missense mutations in the CCKAR gene. The contribution of these CCKAR variants to normal physiology, to obesity, and to diabetes can now be evaluated.
