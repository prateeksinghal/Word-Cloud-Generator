Diabetic patients have a 3-fold higher risk of developing atherosclerosis and its clinical complications as compared to non-diabetic individuals. Part of the cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes is probably due to genetic determinants influencing both glucose homeostasis and the development of atherosclerosis. However, type 2 diabetes frequently coexists with other cardiovascular risk factors like arterial hypertension, central obesity and dyslipidemia. Genetic variability affecting many areas such as lipid and energy metabolisms, hypertension and haemodynamic mechanisms, blood clotting homeostasis, inflammation, and matrix turnover in the vascular wall will have an impact on the development of macrovascular complications in diabetic patients. Adiponectin is abundantly secreted by adipocytes. It plays important roles in lipid and glucose metabolisms and has direct anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects. In this review, we summarize recent data from the literature suggesting an implication of allelic variations of the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) in the genetic determinants of cardiovascular disease in diabetic subjects.
