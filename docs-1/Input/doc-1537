Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Mainly expressed in adipose tissue, PPARgamma promotes the differentiation of adipocytes and modulates the expression of many genes involved in the synthesis of adipocytokines in the adipose tissue. It is also the target molecule of the thiazolidinediones. Polymorphisms of the PPARgamma gene may influence pancreatic beta-cell function and result in changes in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity of the peripheral tissues. They are also associated with risks of type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Elucidation of its mechanism could be of major importance to the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of complex diseases.
