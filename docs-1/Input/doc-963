Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease associated with insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Excessive accumulation of triglycerides (TG) is a hallmark of NAFLD and therefore, a better understanding of the steps involved in regulating hepatic TG synthesis might yield novel information regarding the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. In the recent years, the transcription factor ChRepsilonBP has emerged as a major mediator of glucose action on lipogenic genes and as a key determinant of lipid synthesis in vitro. More importantly, this factor has been described to play a central role in hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance physiopathology. Although its implication in human disease has not yet been demonstrated, ChRepsilonBP could be an interesting therapeutic target against metabolic syndrome components.
