Obesity, whose prevalence is continually rising, is one of the world's greatest health care burdens. This multifactorial condition is associated with many obesity-related conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. Weight loss is a significant challenge facing those wishing to reduce their disease risk. Of course, like obesity itself, weight loss is a complex phenomenon dependent on many environmental and genetic influences, and thus individual responses to weight loss interventions are incredibly variable. Currently, there are 3 major interventions used to reduce weight: diet, exercise, and pharmacotherapy. The findings from studies examining gene-diet (nutrigenetic), gene-exercise (actigenetic), and gene-pharmaceutical (pharmacogenetic) interactions, although not clinically applicable at this time, are gaining awareness. This review article summarizes the current evidence to support the contribution of DNA sequence variation in genes related to energy balance (expenditure and intake) in the response to weight loss intervention. There is no doubt that replication using more rigorous study designs that include the study of interactions between multiple genes and interventions is required to move towards the development of genotype-specific weight loss treatment strategies.
