To describe the function in terms of gene expression, and to find new factors, we performed random complementary DNA (cDNA) sequencing using a 3'-directed cDNA library that faithfully represents the composition of the messenger RNA (mRNA). Through a systematic search of active genes in adipose tissue, we found adiponectin, encoded by the most abundantly expressed gene in adipose tissue, termed apM1 (adipose most abundant gene transcript-1). Fat specific gene library generated in this Japanese Human Genome Project identified many other key molecules of this tissue such as leptin, PPARgamma and aP2 (adipocyte fatty acid binding protein, FABP4), in addition to apM1. Following 10 years, hundreds of clinical studies implicated the critical role of adiponectin in the metabolic syndrome. Also organized establishment of aP2 related mice model revealed the impact of this cytoplasmic fatty acid binding protein in the development of metabolic syndrome. In summary, investigating fat specific genes was amazingly powerful for analyses of the physiology of this tissue, as well as the etiology and complications of obesity.
