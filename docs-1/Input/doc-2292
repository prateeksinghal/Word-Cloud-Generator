The aim of this study was to identify candidate genes for visceral obesity by screening for genes strongly differentially expressed between human subcutaneous and visceral adipose depots. A cDNA microarray with human adipose-derived cDNAs was used as an initial screening to identify genes that are potentially differentially expressed between human subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat tissues. For the two best candidates, carboxypeptidase E (CPE) and thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) (EST N72406), real-time RT-PCR was performed to confirm their depot specific expression in extremely obese individuals. Both genes appeared to be strongly differentially expressed, having a higher expression in the visceral depot than in the subcutaneous one. For THBS1, the difference in expression between the depots was greater in women than in men. The involvement of CPE and THBS1 in obesity allows us to suggest that the physiological processes controlled by these genes contribute to depot and gender-related differences in the metabolic complications of obesity.
