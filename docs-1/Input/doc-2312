Obesity is an important public health problem associated with a number of disease states such as diabetes and arteriosclerosis. As such, an understanding of the mechanisms governing adipose tissue differentiation and function is of considerable importance. We recently reported that the Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor KLF15 can induce adipocyte maturation and GLUT4 expression. In this study, we identify that a second family member, KLF2/Lung Krüppel-like factor (LKLF), as a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation. KLF2 is highly expressed in adipose tissue, and studies in cell lines and primary cells demonstrate that KLF2 is expressed in preadipocytes but not mature adipocytes. Constitutive overexpression of KLF2 but not KLF15 potently inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) expression with no effect on the upstream regulators C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta. However, the expression of C/EBPalpha and SREBP1c/ADD1 (adipocyte determination and differentiation factor-1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1), two factors that feedback in a positive manner to enhance PPARgamma function, was also markedly reduced. In addition, transient transfection studies show that KLF2 directly inhibits PPARgamma2 promoter activity (70% inhibition; p &lt; 0.001). Using a combination of promoter mutational analysis and gel mobility shift assays, we have identified a binding site within the PPARgamma2 promoter, which mediates this inhibitory effect. These data identify a novel role for KLF2 as a negative regulator of adipogenesis.
