Large-scale population-based surveys published in the past decade give new insights regarding risk factors for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. Age plays a significant role in the development of all forms of urinary incontinence, but findings regarding the role of hormonal changes are inconsistent. Obesity is an increasingly prevalent health condition that was shown to have detrimental impact on SUI development, while weight reduction was proven to reduce SUI. Other modifiable risk factors, such as diabetes, also are related to SUI. Pregnancy, delivery, and pelvic floor surgery are risk factors discussed in the review. Recent genetic studies identified several genes encoding components of the extracellular matrix, which could be related to a predisposition to SUI. Identifying risk factors for SUI can facilitate prevention strategies in an aim to reduce SUI prevalence among women.
