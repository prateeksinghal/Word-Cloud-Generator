We report a female patient with a de novo balanced translocation, 46,X,t(X;2)(p11.2;q37)dn, who exhibits seizures, capillary abnormality, developmental delay, infantile hypotonia, and obesity. The 2q37 breakpoint observed in association with the seizure phenotype is of particular interest, because it lies near loci implicated in epilepsy in humans and mice. Fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping of the translocation breakpoints showed that no known genes are disrupted at Xp11.2, whereas diacylglycerol kinase delta (DGKD) is disrupted at 2q37. Expression studies in Drosophila and mouse suggest that DGKD is involved in central nervous system development and function. Electroencephalographic assessment of Dgkd mutant mice revealed abnormal epileptic discharges and electrographic seizures in three of six homozygotes. These findings implicate DGKD disruption by the t(X;2)(p11.2;q37)dn in the observed phenotype and support a more general role for DGKD in the etiology of seizures.
