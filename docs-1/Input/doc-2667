Recently, the presence of different polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the ob gene has been associated with variations in leptin levels. However, the results of these studies are still contradictory. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the presence of the A19G polymorphism in an Italian population of obese patients and to verify its association with leptin levels and anthropometric, metabolic, and clinical parameters. Two hundred five obese patients [body mass index (BMI) &gt; 36 kg/m2; 135 women and 70 men; mean age, 46.9+/-14.23 yr] were screened for presence of the polymorphism; 61 normal-weight controls (mean BMI, 21.05 kg/m2; 53 women, 8 men) were also screened to compare polymorphism frequency. For obese patients, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, resting energy expenditure, body composition, fasting leptin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, and caloric intake were determined. Genotype frequencies in obese and control subjects were compared using the contingency table chi-square test; in obese subjects an ANOVA was performed to evaluate association between the polymorphism and several clinical parameters. No significant differences in genotype distribution between control and obese subjects were found. No significant correlations were found between this polymorphism and serum leptin levels and the other parameters considered. These findings confirm the results obtained in both a Finnish and a French population; taken together, these observations might rule out a significant role for the A19-&gt;G polymorphism in the regulation of leptin levels and other clinical, anthropometric, and metabolic parameters.
