Neuropeptide Y is a 36-amino-acid peptide amide with numerous biological activities. These functions are mediated through several pharmacologically distinct receptors. To date five receptor subtypes have been cloned. Here we report the isolation, by low stringency homology cloning from a hypothalamic library, of a cDNA encoding the human homolog of the murine neuropeptide Y receptor subsequently reported (). Translation of the human Y1-like receptor clone suggested that it encoded a receptor which is truncated in the third extracellular loop. Comparison of the human Y1-like sequence to that of the human Y1 receptor suggested that the truncated receptor could have resulted from a frameshift due to a single nucleotide deletion in the sixth transmembrane domain. Southern blot analysis suggested that the gene is single copy in the human genome. The gene is located on chromosome 5q. To test the hypothesis that allelic variation of nucleic acid length within the sixth transmembrane domain of the Y1-like receptor may exist to produce a functional receptor, genomic DNA from 192 individuals of various ages, ethnic backgrounds, and degrees of obesity were analyzed electrophoretically and by direct sequencing. No variation was detected in any of the subjects, indicating that this receptor subtype may be a transcribed pseudogene in humans.
