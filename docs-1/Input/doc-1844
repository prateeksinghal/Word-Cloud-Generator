The adipocyte hormone leptin binds to its receptors in hypothalamic neurons and decreases appetite and food consumption. Its effect on appetite is mediated by melanocortines (MC) that are derivative of proopiomelanocortin (POMK) and their receptor (MC4-R). The knock-out of POMC gene or MC4-R gene causes obesity in animals. However, the growth of the animals intensifies and their reproductive function does not cease. The paper covers consequences of mutations in genes responsible for leptin regulation of various functions.
