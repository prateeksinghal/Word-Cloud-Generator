Recently, the genes of components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), namely angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptor have been described in adipose tissue. In animal models the angiotensinogen in adipose tissue has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic alterations and hypertension associated with obesity. The aim of our study was to evaluate the AGT gene expression both in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue in obese patients and lean subjects. AGT mRNA levels were measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers. AGT mRNA was expressed at variable levels in obese patients. It was significantly greater in visceral than in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Positive and significant correlation was found between the expression of AGT in visceral adipose tissue and BMI. These data suggest that angiotensinogen may be determinant of fat distribution and may be involved in the plurimetabolic syndrome of central obesity.
