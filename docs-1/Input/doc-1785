Associations of obesity with its candidate genes, beta-adrenergic receptor genes (ADRBs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), and uncoupling proteins (UCPs) were studied in Korean adolescents. We analyzed the obesity-related phenotypes body mass index (BMI), percentage of body fat, plasma leptin and insulin levels, fasting glucose concentration, and plasma lipid profile in 329 teenagers to investigate the effects of seven single nucleotide variants 252G/A, 523C/A and 1053G/C in ADRB2; Trp64Arg in ADRB3; 161C/T in PPARgamma; Ala55Val in UCP2; and 210C/T in UCP3. The 1053G/C polymorphism (P &lt; 0.05) in the ADRB2 gene and the Trp64Arg polymorphism (P &lt; 0.01) in the ADRB3 gene were associated with BMI after adjustment for dietary energy intake. Trp64Arg polymorphism also influenced percentage of body fat (P &lt; 0.01) and plasma leptin level (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, significant interaction effects between the 1053G/C and Trp64Arg polymorphisms were observed on BMI (P &lt; 0.01). The polymorphisms of the ADRB2 and ADRB3 genes explained 4.3% and 10.1% of the variation on BMI, and the two loci effect, including their epistasis, explained 18.3%. We concluded that 1053G/C and Trp64Arg polymorphisms of the ADRB genes additively and interactively contributed to the variation of complex adolescent obesity.
