Several clinical and animal studies indicate that essential hypertension is inherited as a multifactorial trait with a significant genetic and environmental component. In the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat model, investigators have found evidence for linkage to blood pressure regulatory genes (quantitative trait loci) on rat chromosomes 2, 10, and X. In 1 human study of French and UK sib pairs, evidence for linkage has been reported to human chromosome 17q, the syntenic region of the rat chromosome 10 quantitative trait loci (QTL). Our study confirms this linkage (P=0.0005) and refines the location of the blood pressure QTL.
