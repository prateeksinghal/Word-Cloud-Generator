Visceral fat accumulation often accompanies various complications, such as insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Adipose tissue has been found to secrete various biologically active adipocytokines including free fatty acids. Accumulation of visceral fat increases the portal free fatty acids concentration to cause insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Tumor necrosis alpha (TNF alpha) deteriorates insulin resistance in obesity. The levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor(PAI)-1 increase and plasma adiponectin concentration decreases in obesity leading to the development of vascular disease. The finding of genes specifically expressed in visceral fat and new adipocytokines should facilitate clarification of the mechanism for the development and complications of visceral fat accumulation.
