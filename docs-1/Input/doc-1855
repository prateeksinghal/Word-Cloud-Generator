Metabolic syndrome refers to the clustering of disease conditions such as insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. To explore the genetic predispositions of this complex syndrome, we conducted a principal components analysis using data on 14 phenotypes related to the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. The subjects were 566 nondiabetic Mexican Americans, distributed in 41 extended families from the San Antonio Family Heart Study. The factor scores obtained from these 14 phenotypes were used in multipoint linkage analysis using SOLAR. Factors were identified that accounted for 73% of the total variance of the original variables: body size-adiposity, insulin-glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels. Each factor exhibited evidence for either significant or suggestive linkage involving four factor-specific chromosomal regions relating to chromosomes 1, 3, 4, and 6. Significant evidence for linkage of the lipid factor was found on chromosome 4 near marker D4S403 (LOD = 3.52), where the cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR) and ADP-ribosyl cyclase 1 (CD38) genes are located. Suggestive evidence for linkage of the body size-adiposity factor to chromosome 1 near marker D1S1597 (LOD = 2.53) in the region containing the nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 gene (NROB2) also was observed. The insulin-glucose and blood pressure factors were linked suggestively to regions on chromosome 3 near marker D3S1595 (LOD = 2.20) and on chromosome 6 near marker D6S 1031 (LOD = 2.08), respectively. In summary, our findings suggest that the factor structures for the risk of metabolic syndrome are influenced by multiple distinct genes across the genome.
