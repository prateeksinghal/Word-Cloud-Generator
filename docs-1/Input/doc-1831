The identification of genetic polymorphisms as risk factors for complex diseases can be relevant for their prevention, diagnosis, and prognosis. The apolipoprotein A-IV: 360 Gln/His polymorphism was investigated in 383 elderly individuals, who were participants of a longitudinal study commenced in 1991. The major morbidities that affect elderly people, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, low cognitive function, depression, and obesity, were extensively investigated. DNA was isolated from blood cells, amplified by PCR, and digested with Fnu4HI. In this population the frequency of the His allele was 0.056 and the genotypes were distributed according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between the presence of His allele and cerebrovascular disease and/or transitory ischemic attack (odds ratio) (OR = 3.070, P = 0.027), obesity (OR = 2.241, P = 0.047), and depression (OR = 2.879, P = 0.005). This study indicates that the presence of the rare allele in elderly people can play a significant role in the occurrence of multifactorial diseases. This is the first study analyzing this polymorphism in elderly people in Brazil. More studies should be encouraged to elucidate the mechanisms involved in these diseases.
