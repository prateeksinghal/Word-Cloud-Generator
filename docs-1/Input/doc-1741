Obesity is a condition of excess body fat that causes or exacerbates several major public health problems. Remarkable progress has been made in the molecular elucidation of monogenic forms of obesity both in rodents and in humans. The most common form of obesity, however, is considered to be a polygenic disorder arising from the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Identification and characterization of susceptibility genes underlying obesity will contribute to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of obesity and ultimately will assist in the development of better strategies for prevention and therapeutic intervention. In this article, we discuss the current status and future perspectives for the genetic dissection of obesity, with a focus on the most striking or representative findings.
