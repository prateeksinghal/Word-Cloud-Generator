The goal of pharmacogenetics is to define the genetic determinants of individual drug responsiveness, and thereby provide personalized treatment to each individual. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are polypeptide products of a set of related genes functioning to regulate several cellular processes that are central to cardiovascular health and disease. Given their pleiotropic roles in lipid and glucose homeostasis, cardiac energy balance and regulation of adipocyte release of circulating inflammatory factors, it is not surprising that PPARs represent an attractive target for clinical investigation and intervention in disease states, such as diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Research into the manipulation of PPAR function by pharmacologic agents has already resulted in important advances in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. It follows that PPAR pharmacogenetics promises important advances in the personalized treatment of cardiovascular disease.
