A population-based cohort of people with a clinical diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) was genetically assessed using molecular diagnostic methods and subsequently divided into the following genetic subtypes involving chromosome 15: 'deletion', 'disomy' and genetically negative (referred to as 'PWS-like'). The physical and behavioral characteristics of the three groups were compared in order to evaluate the unique characteristics of the phenotype resulting from loss of expression of imprinted genes at 15q11q13 (PWS vs. PWS-like cases), the possible effect of either haploid insufficiency of non-imprinted genes (deletion cases), or gain of function of imprinted genes (disomy cases) located within the PWS critical region at 15q11q13. In this study, the main differences between probands with either a deletion or disomy are considered, and the possible involvement of contributing genes discussed. The differences within the PWS group proved difficult to quantify. It would appear that haploid insufficiency or gain of function are more subtle contributors than gender-specific genomic imprinting in the production of the PWS phenotype.
