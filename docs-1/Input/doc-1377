Thyroid dysfunction is associated with several abnormalities in intermediary metabolism, including impairment of lipolytic response to catecholamines in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SCAAT). Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a powerful lipolytic peptide; however, the role of ANP-mediated lipolysis in thyroid disease has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of thyroid hormones in the regulation of ANP-induced lipolysis as well as in the gene expression of hormone-sensitive lipase, phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B), uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), natriuretic peptide receptor type A, and beta(2)-adrenergic receptor in SCAAT of hyperthyroid and hypothyroid patients. Gene expression in SCAAT was studied in 13 hypothyroid and 11 hyperthyroid age-matched women before and 2-4 mo after the normalization of their thyroid status. A microdialysis study was performed on a subset of nine hyperthyroid and 10 hypothyroid subjects. ANP- and isoprenaline-induced lipolyses were higher in hyperthyroid subjects, with no differences between the groups following treatment. Hormone-sensitive lipase gene expression was higher in hyperthyroid compared with hypothyroid subjects before treatment, whereas no difference was observed following treatment. No differences in gene expression of other genes were observed between the two groups. Following treatment, the gene expression of UCP2 decreased in hyperthyroid, whereas the expression of PDE3B decreased in hypothyroid subjects. We conclude that thyroid hormones regulate ANP- and isoprenaline-mediated lipolysis in human SCAAT in vivo. Increased lipolytic subcutaneous adipose tissue response in hyperthyroid patients may involve postreceptor signaling mechanisms.
