A novel locus in the human Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) region encodes the imprinted ZNF127 and antisense ZNF127AS genes. Here, we show that the mouse ZNF127 ortholog, Zfp127, encodes a homologous putative zinc-finger polypeptide, with a RING (C3HC4) and three C3H zinc-finger domains that suggest function as a ribonucleoprotein. By the use of RT-PCR across an in-frame hexamer tandem repeat and RNA from a Mus musculus x M.spretus F1interspecific cross, we show that Zfp127 is expressed only from the paternal allele in brain, heart and kidney. Similarly, Zfp127 is expressed in differentiated cells derived from androgenetic embryonic stem cells and normal embryos but not those from parthogenetic embryonic stem cells. We hypothesize that the gametic imprint may be set, at least in part, by the transcriptional activity of Zfp127 in pre- and post-meiotic male germ cells. Therefore, Zfp127 is a novel imprinted gene that may play a role in the imprinted phenotype of mouse models of PWS.
