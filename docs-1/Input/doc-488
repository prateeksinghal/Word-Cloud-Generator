Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. Fifty percent of patients fulfil the criteria for the metabolic syndrome. The pathogenesis of PCOS may be looked as a vicious cycle involving hyperandrogenemia, central obesity, and insulin resistance and medical treatment should aim at breaking this cycle. Lifestyle intervention, oral contraceptives, and insulin sensitises such as metformin are the most commonly used treatment modalities. The thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone and pioglitazone were recently applied as insulin sensitising treatment in patients with PCOS. Thiazolidinediones activate the transcription of genes that affect glucose and lipid metabolism mediating decreased free fatty acid levels and decreased visceral fat mass. In the present article, we give an overview of the diverse effects of glitazone treatment in patients with PCOS. We review the studies comparing glitazone versus metformin and oral contraceptive treatment and recommend which patients should be treated with glitazones in daily praxis.
