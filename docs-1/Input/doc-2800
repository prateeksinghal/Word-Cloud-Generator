High hepatic lipase (HL) activity is associated with an atherogenic lipoprotein profile of small, dense LDL particles and lower HDL(2)-C. Intra-abdominal fat (IAF) is positively associated with HL activity. A hepatic lipase gene (LIPC) promoter variant (G--&gt;A(-250)) is associated with lower HL activity, higher HDL(2)-C, and less dense LDL particles. To determine whether the LIPC promoter polymorphism acts independently of IAF to regulate HL, 57 healthy, premenopausal women were studied. The LIPC promoter A allele was associated with significantly lower HL activity (GA/AA=104+/-34 versus GG=145+/-57 nmoles x mL(-1) x min(-1), P=0.009). IAF was positively correlated with HL activity (r=0.431, P&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed a strong relationship between both the LIPC promoter genotype (P=0. 001) and IAF (P&lt;0.001) with HL activity. The relationship between IAF and HL activity for carriers and noncarriers of the A allele was curvilinear with the carriers having a lower apparent maximum level of plasma HL activity compared with noncarriers (138 versus 218 nmoles x mL(-1) x min(-1), P&lt;0.001). In addition, the LIPC A allele was associated with a significantly higher HDL(2)-C (GA/AA=16+/-7 versus GG=11+/-5 mg/dL, P=0.003). We conclude that the LIPC promoter A allele attenuates the increase in HL activity due to IAF in premenopausal women.
