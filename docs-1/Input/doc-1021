Oxidative stress during successive ovulations increases the opportunity for DNA damage to ovarian epithelial cells and the potential for malignant transformation. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an endogenous free radical scavenger that reduces oxidative stress. The association of two common functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rs854560 T&gt;A and rs662 A&gt;G, with the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer was examined in a population-based case-control study in Hawaii. A personal interview and blood specimens were collected from 274 women with histologically confirmed, primary ovarian cancer and 452 controls frequency matched on age and ethnicity. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression. Both PON1 SNPs were significantly associated with ovarian cancer risk. The ORs were 0.53 (95% CI, 0.35-0.79; P for allele-dose effect = 0.01) for women carrying the rs854560 T allele compared with women with the AA genotype and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.44-0.95; P for allele-dose effect = 0.03) for women carrying the rs662 A allele compared with women with the GG genotype. The association of the rs854560 T genotype with risk was stronger among smokers (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.64; P for allele-dose effect = 0.0007) than among nonsmokers (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.40-1.18; P for allele-dose effect = 0.53). The decreased risk associated with the rs854560 T allele was also stronger among obese women (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.55; P for allele-dose effect = 0.007) than among nonobese women (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40-0.98; P for allele-dose effect = 0.16). Our study provides evidence for an association of two PON1 SNPs with the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. Possible effect modification of these associations by tobacco smoking and obesity needs confirmation in other studies.
