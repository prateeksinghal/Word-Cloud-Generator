The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of nuclear transcription factors that belong to the steroid receptor superfamily. PPARs family includes PPARalpha, PPARbeta/delta, PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2. PPARs form an heterodimer with the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and bind to response elements present in target genes activated by these transcription factors. PPARs control the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, oxidation and storage. PPARs are present in most tissues, where PPARalpha is most abundant in liver and skeletal muscle, whereas PPARgamma is found mainly in adipose tissue. Natural ligands for PPARs are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and some eicosanoids, however they are also activated by compounds such as fibrates and thiazolidinediones (TZDs). In this review is shown the different PPARs isoforms, identification, and regulation of their expression and activity. Also shows which are the natural ligands, and the chemical compounds that activate PPARs. Finally, it shows the target genes activated by the different isoforms of PPARs, the metabolic integration between the different PPAR isoforms to maintain a balance between fatty acid synthesis and oxidation and the association with the development of obesity and insulin resistance. Also shows information about the nutritional requirements of PUFAs that are the main natural ligands of PPARs.
