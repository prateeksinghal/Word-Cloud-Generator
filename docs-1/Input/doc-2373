Panel 5 focused on genetic factors that might mediate or moderate the effects of caloric restriction (CR) on longevity. Panel members stated that currently there is limited information directly addressing these issues. Therefore, they focused attention on what studies could be done. In addition, the panel believed that certain conceptual issues merited clarification and focused attention on this issue. Human studies and studies of nonhuman model organisms were discussed. The panel found at least three reasons why it would be valuable to find genes that influence the (putative) longevity-promoting effect of CR in humans. Such knowledge would offer: (a) the ability to predict individual responses to CR; (b) increased understanding of physiological mechanisms; and (c) the potential to develop mechanism-based interventions to promote longevity or healthy aging. In addition, the panel emphasized several macro-level recommendations regarding research strategies to avoid, research strategies to emphasize, and resources needing development.
