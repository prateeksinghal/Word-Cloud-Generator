Lipolysis in adipose tissue and balance between energy intake and expenditure are involved in the regulation of adipose tissue mass. Several recent findings suggest that alterations in the regulation of lipolysis and/or energy balance might contribute to the development of obesity. Hormone-sensitive lipase and uncoupling proteins play important role in regulation of lipolysis in adipose tissue as well as in the regulation of energy balance of various tissues. Mechanisms of the control of expression of genes coding synthesis of these proteins are poorly known. A brief overview of the present knowledge of the effects of nutritional intervention on the regulation of lipolysis in adipose tissue and on the expression of genes of hormone-sensitive lipase and that of uncoupling proteins is given in this article. Results of the authors' studies on the effect of calorie restriction on gene expression in adipose tissue are presented.
