Given that a large number of candidate genes coding for a tendency toward obesity have been identified and some findings have been replicated, we explored characteristics of those who would be most likely to obtain future genetic testing for this tendency. During a series of focus groups, obese respondents rated their likelihood of obtaining testing under conditions in which either genetically-targeted drug treatment would be available, a positive test would be associated with a prognosis for developing diabetes, or neither of these. Interest in testing was greater given the first two scenarios than the third. Older age and belief that genetics were an important cause of obesity were associated with greater interest. For the first two scenarios, higher educational status was associated with greater interest, while for the third, respondents who said emotional issues caused overweight and those who crash-dieted intermittently were more likely to want genetic testing. Although further research is required to validate these findings, this study is the first published report of respondents' ratings of likelihood to obtain genetic testing for propensity to obesity, and suggests strong interest in genetic testing among some people, even in the absence of further treatment implications of the test.
