Prevalence of uterine progesterone receptors over estrogen ones, high uterine cAMP level, and low uterine prostaglandin level are necessary conditions of normal pregnancy. In cases of spontaneous and antiprogestin RU486-induced abortions, estrogen receptors prevail over progesterone ones, cAMP level decreases, and prostaglandin concentration in decidual tissue increases. Porcine and bovine beta-lipotropines were the first proteins, whose correct amino acid sequence was first determined in Russia. Several research centers carried out collaborative studies of the nucleotide sequences of human and animal proopiomelanocortin (lipotropin precursor) and prolactin cDNA. Researchers constructed genetic engineering producers of human pre-proinsulin and somatostatin, identified structural genes expressed in pancreatic beta-cells, studied antigenic properties of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), which determine insulin-dependent diabetes, and identified the cholesterase determinant. They revealed mutations in the genes of proopiomelanocortin and melanocortin receptors (MC4-P), which inhibit leptin regulation of appetite and are associated with human obesity.
