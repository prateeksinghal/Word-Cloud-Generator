We seek to discover an effective method for utilizing thermogenesis to reduce the caloric load in obese individuals. Experimental evidence indicates that nonshivering thermogenesis is the most effective cellular and biochemical mechanism known for reducing excessive adiposity. In this presentation, we describe our experiments aimed at understanding how nonshivering thermogenesis can be induced. In addition, these experiments have led to a genetic approach for the identification of variant genes that coordinate the expression of pathways of gene transcription that are associated with brown adipocyte induction.
