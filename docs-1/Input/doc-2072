Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes are modern pandemics caused by unique genetic-environmental interactions and distinguished by almost universal treatment failures. Relative influences of genome and lifestyle changes on an adult onset Obesity-Type 2 diabetes phenotype were explored. Zucker rats, a recessive model of genetic obesity-Type 2 Diabetes (117 fa/fa and 98 Fa/fa) were used. Dietary induced obesity (DIO) was imposed via a high fat diet on one-half; and one-half were forced to swim daily (EX). After 6 weeks, 78 animals were placed on a calorie (Kcal) restrictive diet for 6 more weeks. Genotype accounted for &gt; 20% additional insulin resistance and obesity and modulated the effects of DIO and EX in adult animals exhibiting obesity-Type 2 diabetes. Only DIO gains were responsive to Kcal restriction. EX effects on insulin resistance were mediated by both Kcal restriction and genotype. Kcal restriction directly reduced hyperglycemia. Genetic variation was the major determinant of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in Zucker rats. Genetically induced obesity and insulin sensitivity were resistant to EX and Kcal restriction; DIO and hyperglycemia were responsive to both. Successful treatment of Type 2 Diabetes requires understanding of how genotype may continue to modify adult responses to lifestyle change.
