An early molecular event in the evolution of insulin-dependent diabetes in humans and NOD mice appears to involve the interaction of MHC class II molecules, beta-cell autoantigen-derived peptides, and receptor molecules of helper T lymphocytes. To examine the influence of T-lymphocyte-receptor beta-genes on the development of beta-cell autoimmunity, (NOD x NZW)F1 x NOD backcrossed (BC) mice were studied for the development of insulitis, because insulitis is the pathognomonic histological lesion of autoimmune diabetes. Heterozygosity for H-2nod was permissive for the development of pancreatic interstitial inflammation and peri-islet insulitis, whereas homozygosity for H-2nod was highly associated with insulitis. However, (NOD x NZW)F1 x NOD BC mice developed insulitis regardless of homozygosity or heterozygosity for T-lymphocyte receptor beta nod. Therefore, in our study, T-lymphocyte receptor beta nod did not function as an autosomal-recessive beta-cell autoimmunity gene.
