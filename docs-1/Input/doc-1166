There is growing evidence that immune functions are linked to the regulation of body fat. Our studies of knockout mice indicate that both endogenous interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 can suppress mature-onset obesity. We now investigated whether four common polymorphisms of the IL6 and IL1 systems are associated with the fat mass measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in elderly men (n = 3,014). The study subjects were from the Swedish part of the MrOS multicenter population study and 69-81 years of age. The IL6 -174 G&gt;C (Minor allele frequency (MAF) = 48%) gene promoter polymorphism was associated with the primary outcome total fat mass (P = 0.006) and regional fat masses, but not with lean body mass. The IL1B -31T&gt;C (MAF = 34%) polymorphism was also associated with total fat (P = 0.007) and regional fat masses, but not lean body mass. The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene (IL1RN) +2018 T&gt;C (MAF = 27%) polymorphism (in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a well-studied variable number tandem repeat of 86 base pair (bp)) and IL1B +3953 C&gt;T (MAF = 26%) polymorphism were not associated with total fat mass. In conclusion, the IL-1 and IL-6 systems, shown to suppress mature-onset obesity in experimental animals, contain gene polymorphisms that are associated with fat, but not lean, mass in elderly men.
