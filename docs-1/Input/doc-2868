The Trp64Arg beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) variant is associated with visceral obesity probably due to decreased lipolysis in visceral fat (H. Kim-Motoyama et al., Diabetologia 40, 469-472, 1997). Functional alteration of beta2AR may also change fat distribution. We investigated the influence of the Gln27Glu beta2AR variant upon obesity and fat distribution. We screened 278 unrelated Japanese men and detected 249 wild-type Gln27 homozygotes, 28 Gln27/Glu27 heterozygotes, and one mutant Glu27 homozygote. The frequency of mutant Glu27 allele was significantly higher in obese subjects than in nonobese/intermediate subjects (0.11 vs 0.04, P = 0. 004). The Gln27/Glu27 heterozygotes had a significantly higher mean age-adjusted body-mass index (BMI) and mean age-adjusted subcutaneous fat area assessed by CT scan than the wild-type homozygotes but not the mean age-adjusted visceral fat areas. In summary, we have found that in Japanese men the Gln27Glu beta2AR variant is associated with obesity due to subcutaneous fat accumulation.
