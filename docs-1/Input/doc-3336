Although Angelman (AS) and Prader-Willi (PWS) syndromes are human genetic disorders with distinctly different developmental and neurobehavioural phenotypes, they both have abnormalities in inheritance of chromosome 15q11-q13. Whether AS or PWS arises depends on the parental origin of a deletion or uniparental disomy (the inheritance of 2 copies of a genetic locus from only one parent) for 15q11-q13. Normal development requires a genetic contribution for this genetic region from both a male and a female parent. The dependence on parental origin implies that genes in human 15q11-q13 have distinct functions depending upon epigenetic, parent-of-origin differences, known as genomic imprinting. Here, I review the role of uniparental disomy and genomic imprinting in the pathogenesis of AS and PWS, and briefly discuss phenotype-genotype correlations using candidate genes and mouse models, in particular for hypopigmentation.
