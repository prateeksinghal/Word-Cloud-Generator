The mouse ob gene and its human homologue OB have recently been cloned. The mutations in the ob gene are known to be associated with extreme obesity. The relationship between the human OB gene and disease, however, is largely unknown due to the lack of suitable markers within or adjacent to the OB gene. To obtain informative markers, we searched for simple tandem repeat polymorphisms in the genomic sequence of the human OB gene and identified a novel tetranucleotide repeat in the 3' flanking region. Fifteen alleles were detected in this marker with a heterozygosity of 0.85 and polymorphism information content of 0.83, indicating a highly informative nature of this marker. Two-point linkage mapping in two Centre Etude Polymorphisme Humaine (CEPH) reference families suggested that this marker is located in the interval between D7S514 and D7S530, the same interval where the OB gene is located (recombination fractions with D7S514 and D7S530 were 0.026 and 0.034, respectively). Although allele frequency distributions of this marker did not differ between 84 control subjects and 69 NIDDM patients, there was a tendency to higher body weight in control subjects with class I/class I genotype than in those without this genotype (68.8 +/- 11.1 vs 60.8 +/- 10.3 kg, p = 0.05). The highly polymorphic nature of this marker and its location in the OB gene makes this marker useful for linkage studies of the OB gene with a number of phenotypes, such as obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and the insulin resistance syndrome.
