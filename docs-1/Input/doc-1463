Conflicting data suggest an association between leptin gene polymorphisms and essential hypertension independently of obesity. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in severely obese subjects, the role of one of these polymorphic markers in relation to the development of hypertension. The study included 325 obese patients with mean body mass index (BMI) of 46+/-6.94 kg/m2. One hundred sixty-six were hypertensive and 159 normotensive. In both groups, the presence of a tetranucleotide repeat in the 3' flanking region of the Ob gene was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Due to the genetic variant, in the region studied it is possible to distinguish two alleles with different size distribution: Class I (shorter one) and Class II (longer one). Class I and Class II allele frequencies were not significantly different in obese patients when analyzed according to the presence or absence of hypertension. The results presented herein do not support a significant association of this Ob gene polymorphism with hypertension. These findings are in contrast with that reported in other populations. However, we cannot rule out that different ethnicity and/or phenotypic variability might mask small effects.
