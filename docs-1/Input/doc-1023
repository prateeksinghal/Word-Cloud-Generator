The incretin system has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose dependent manner and currently fosters considerable hope for the treatment of diabetes. Recently, we have shown that the dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) gene, which is responsible for incretin inactivation, was overexpressed in omental adipose tissue of obese men with the metabolic syndrome, compared to men not characterized by this condition. Since the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile shows substantial inter-individual variability in obesity, this study aimed at verifying whether DPP4 polymorphisms contribute to explain such a difference. In the first step of this multi-stage study, seven tagging SNPs were genotyped in a sample of 576 obese (BMI&gt;40 kg/m(2)) individuals and tested for their association with blood pressure and lipids, as well as diabetes-related phenotypes. Then, in an additional sample of 572 obese individuals (stage 2), SNPs showing trends (P&lt;0.10) for an association in the first sample were genotyped and reanalyzed. Logistic regressions were used to compute odds ratio for obesity-related metabolic complications. In sample 1, homozygotes for rs17848915 and rs7608798 minor alleles were at lower risk of hyperglycemia/diabetes (P=0.002) and elevated plasma triglyceride levels (P=0.030) respectively, whereas rs1558957 heterozygotes were at higher risk to have high plasma triglyceride (P=0.040), HDL- (P=0.021), LDL- (P=0.001) and total-cholesterol (P=0.003) levels. However, none of these associations was consistently replicated in stage 2. This first comprehensive genetic analysis does not support the notion that DPP4 polymorphisms could modulate the CVD risk profile among obese patients.
