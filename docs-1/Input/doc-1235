The genetic background of obesity is under research. Obesity-related phenotype candidate genes include the gene encoding adiponectin (AdipoQ). In this study, exon 3 of the adiponectin gene was screened for the Y111 H (Tyr111His, or T415C, rs17366743) polymorphism, and adiponectin serum concentrations were measured in 206 obese subjects (110 women and 96 men, aged 50.5+/-16.9 years). Their BMI, % of body fat, plasma glucose, insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured. Adiponectin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. A fragment of exon 3 of the adiponectin gene was amplified in PCR and screened for the Y111 H polymorphism in SSCP analysis. Genetic screening revealed a different SSCP pattern in 2 subjects. Subsequent genotyping disclosed the TC genotype in both subjects, resulting in Y111 H heterozygote variant frequency of 0.01 in the whole cohort. Other results for SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) positive and negative subjects were as follows, respectively: BMI (kg/m (2)) 39.95+/-9.83 vs. 38.12+/-8.56; waist circumference (cm) 122+/-18.4 vs.115+/-16; glucose (mmol/l) 7.51+/-1.86 vs. 5.56+/-0.74; HbA1c (%) 7.55+/-1.86 vs. 6.58+/-1.36; body fat (%) 51+/-2 vs. 44+/-10; plasma insulin (mU/l) 28.92+/-16.50 vs. 37.59+/-47.34; adiponectin (ng/ml) 1301+/-15.8 vs. 5682+/-4156. Due to a proportion of 2 vs. 204, statistical calculations were not possible. The Y111 H adiponectin gene variant is uncommon in Polish obese subjects. Although we observed low adiponectin concentrations in Y111 H SNP heterozygote carriers, this finding was not confirmed by statistics.
