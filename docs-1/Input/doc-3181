Rather than a link in a causal chain leading to hypertension, insulin resistance and resultant hyperinsulinemia may be 'spokes on a wheel', with central or visceral obesity as the postulated hub of the wheel. Hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and high density lipoprotein cholesterol are depicted as other spokes. Newly identified metabolic pathways in adipose tissue or the modulating effects of various predisposing genes may lead to variable expression of various components of the multiple metabolic syndrome in individuals with a predisposition to the collection of visceral fat.
