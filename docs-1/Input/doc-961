Recent studies have provided some clues with regard to the relationship existing between uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and blood pressure in animal experiments. In an attempt to determine the genetic polymorphisms that are associated with blood pressure in humans, we have analyzed genetic polymorphisms in UCP1 gene. In this study, we assessed the association between UCP1 genotypes and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), in a population comprised of 832 Korean female subjects, using a general linear model, which was adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI). Among 4 genetic polymorphisms and the haplotypes constructed from them, haplotype3 of UCP1, UCP1-ht3[GAGA], evidenced significant associations with SBP (p=0.005) and DBP (p=0.013). However, this haplotype was not significantly associated with obesity phenotypes, including BMI or fat mass (p&gt;0.05), thereby suggesting that its association with blood pressure was independent of obesity phenotypes.
