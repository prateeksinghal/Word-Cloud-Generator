Mechanisms underlying antipsychotic cardiometabolic adverse effects are incompletely understood. This hampers the identification of high-risk patients, low-risk antipsychotics and preventive/ameliorative treatments. Recent clinical, molecular and genetic data suggest that: (i) antipsychotic-naïve samples provide the greatest power for mechanistic studies; (ii) weight and metabolic effects can be discordant, pointing to overlapping and distinct mechanisms; (iii) antipsychotics affect satiety and energy homeostasis signaling; (iv) the specific peptides mediating these effects are unknown but probably overlap with those involved in idiopathic obesity; and (v) single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding known neurotransmitter receptors and metabolic proteins are promising pharmacogenomic targets for countering adverse affects. However, sophisticated molecular studies and genome-wide association studies, ideally in antipsychotic-naïve/first episode samples, are needed to further advance the field.
