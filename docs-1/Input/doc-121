The Adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene encodes adipose tissue-secreted hormone, Adiponectin, which is secreted to the bloodstream by adipocytes. Adiponectin is a hormone with anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties and plays a significant role in insulin sensitivity and obesity. The genetic variations in ADIPOQ gene change the circulating adiponectin level and may cause insulin resistance. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the frequency of a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ADIPOQ gene (+45T/G) and adiponectin receptor-2 (ADIPOR2) gene (+795G/A) in Iranian population and to correlate these data with other populations. A hundred healthy volunteers were enrolled to identify the genotype of ADIPOQ gene (+45T/G) and ADIPOR2 gene (+795G/A). This was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Genotype frequencies for ADIPOQ (+45T/G) were 0.789 for TT, 0.164 for TG, and 0.0468 for GG. Allelic frequencies were 0.87 and 0.13 for T and G, respectively. Genotype frequencies for ADIPOR2 (+795G/A) were 0.09 for AA, 0.3 for AG, and 0.61 for GG; allelic frequencies were 0.24 for A and 0.76 for G. Comparisons between ADIPOQ and ADIPOR2 polymorphisms in Iranian population with those in other populations showed significant differences.
