A polymorphism in the promoter region of uncoupling protein 2 gene -866 G/A has been associated with its expression levels, the risk of obesity, and metabolic abnormalities. We aimed to investigate the associations of uncoupling protein (UCP)2 gene variants with obesity and related traits. A total of 440 subjects, 200 obese, and 240 non-obese individuals were included in this case-control study. Hormone and glucose levels were estimated using standard protocols. Genotyping of UCP-2 gene polymorphism for all subjects was performed by the PCR-RFLP polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Higher Systolic blood pressure, Diastolic blood pressure, Waist to hip ratio, Leptin, Insulin, and blood glucose levels were observed in obese than non-obese (P &lt; 0.05). The distributions of genotype (0.001) and allele (0.003) were significantly different between the non-obese and the obese groups. In the obese group, subjects with the A allele showed significant high insulin levels (&lt;0.001) in comparison with A allele non-carriers. In conclusion, our results suggest that the -866 AA genotype and A allele of the UCP2 gene is associated with obesity and A allele associated with hyperinsulinemia in obese subjects.
