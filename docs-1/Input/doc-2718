We screened the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 2 (PPAR gamma 2) for sequence variants in 165 unrelated obese (BMI &gt;/= 30 kg/m(2)) Caucasian women, and 49 normal weight Caucasian female controls (BMI &lt; 27 kg/m(2)). The allele frequency of the Pro12Ala mutation was higher in obese(18.18%) than in normal weight women (8. 16%) (chi(2)((1)) = 5.68, P = 0.017). Among obese women, the Pro12Ala mutation lowered age of obesity onset (Pro/Pro, 13.2 +/- 9. 4 years; Pro/Ala+Ala/Ala 8.6 +/- 7.1 years, P = 0.005), was associated with lower fasting glucose and was protective against type II diabetes.
