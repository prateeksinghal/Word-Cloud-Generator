Both type 2 diabetes and hypertension are multifactorial diseases. Several lines of evidence suggested that common genetic factors contribute to both conditions. Genes responsible for obesity and insulin resistance are candidates for common genetic factors. Among candidate genes are genes encoding glycogen synthase, beta 3-adrenergic receptor, glycogen-associated regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase-1, peroxisome proliferator--activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma), leptin and adiponectin. In addition, recent genome scans mapped loci linked to type 2 diabetes, hypertension and/or metabolic syndrome. Identification of genes responsible for both type 2 diabetes and hypertension will increase our understanding of molecular mechanisms of these conditions and facilitate the development of effective methods for prevention and intervention of diabetes and hypertension as well as metabolic syndrome.
