Feeding a high carbohydrate diet induces transcription of more than 15 genes involved in the metabolic conversion of glucose to fat. A new transcription factor binding to a glucose response element of the pyruvate kinase and lipogenesis enzyme genes was discovered recently. This factor, termed carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP), is activated in response to high glucose and up-regulates these genes. Cyclic AMP and a high fat diet inhibit ChREBP and slow down glucose utilization. ChREBP is able to control transcription of lipogenic enzyme genes in response to nutritional and hormonal inputs, and may play an important role in disease states such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension.
