Leptin, an adipocyte-secreted hormone, is one of the central regulators of body weight homeostasis. In humans and rodents, two major forms of leptin receptors (OB-R) are expressed. The short form (OB-RS), considered to lack signaling capability, is detected in many organs. In contrast, OB-R long form (OB-RL) predominates in the hypothalamus, but is also present at low levels in peripheral tissues. Transient transfection experiments have demonstrated that OB-RL transduces an intracellular signaling similar to interleukin (IL)-6 type-cytokine receptors. To define the specificity by which OB-R induces genes and cooperates with signal transduction pathways utilized by other hormones and cytokines, rat and human hepatoma cell lines were generated which stably express human OB-RL. Hepatoma cell lines selected for appreciable levels of OB-RL mRNA display enhanced leptin binding and responded to leptin with an IL-6 receptor-like signaling that includes the activation of STAT proteins, induction of acute-phase plasma proteins, and synergism with IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. A leptin-mediated recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to insulin receptor substrate-2 was also detected. However, no significant tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-2 and modulation of the immediate cell response to insulin were observed. The data suggest that OB-RL action in hepatic cells is equivalent to that of IL-6 receptor. However, leptin does not play a specific role in muting insulin action on hepatoma cells and therefore may not contribute to the diabetic symptoms associated with obesity.
