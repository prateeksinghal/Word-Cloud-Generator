Peptide-YY (PYY) is secreted from endocrine L-cells of the gastrointestinal tract in response to caloric ingestion and may mediate postprandial satiety through the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y2 receptor (Y2R). We examined whether variants in the genes encoding PYY and Y2R might be associated with obesity-related phenotypes in humans. Among 101 subjects with severe early-onset obesity and a history of hyperphagia, we found two rare sequence variants-L73P and IVS2 + 32delG-in PYY and three rare missense mutations-L40F, F87I, and A172T-in Y2R. Although none of these were found in 100 normal-weight white control subjects, L73P in PYY and F87I and A172T in Y2R did not segregate with obesity in family studies, and family data were unavailable for IVS2 + 32delG in PYY and L40F in Y2R. Two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), R72T and IVS3 + 68C&gt;T, in PYY were in tight linkage disequilibrium but showed no association with BMI in a large white population. In the Y2R, two SNPs, 585T&gt;C and 936T&gt;C, were found and were in tight linkage disequilibrium. Men, homozygous for the rarer variant, had significantly lower BMI (P = 0.017), waist-to-hip ratio (P = 0.013), and, surprisingly, higher nonesterified fatty acid levels (P = 0.01). In conclusion, mutations in PYY and Y2R are not commonly found in humans with severe early-onset obesity. The relationship between common variants in Y2R and obesity-related traits deserves further exploration in other populations.
