To understand the effects of the interaction between genetic polymorphisms and obesity on the risk of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), two polymorphisms, an SstI polymorphism on the apolipoprotein CIII gene and a HindIII polymorphism on the lipoprotein lipase gene, were analyzed in 339 Chinese subjects with (82 cases in the HTG group) or without HTG (257 cases in the control group). Our data revealed that the frequencies of obesity, the SstI minor allele (S2), and the HindIII major allele (H+) in the HTG group were significantly higher than in the control group. Subgroup analysis revealed that the association between these two polymorphisms and HTG occurred predominantly in nonobese subjects and in subjects with the less hypertriglyceridemic genotype of another polymorphism. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that all three risk factors (obesity, S2-containing chromosome, and H+ homozygosity) were associated with HTG, and an interaction was found between obesity and H+ homozygosity for the occurrence of HTG. The risk of HTG increased significantly with combinations of risk factors. Subjects can be divided into low or high risk groups for HTG using such combinations. These results provide evidence of interaction between obesity and the HindIII polymorphism of the lipoprotein lipase gene on the risk of HTG.
