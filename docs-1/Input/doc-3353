The study of genes, drugs, and behavior in three male adolescents with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) revealed a clinical profile that raises questions about the indications for neuroleptic and appetite-suppressing medications in this condition. Evidence of the inadvisability of neuroleptic medication and of the pathophysiology of PWS has led to a remarkable control of violent outbursts and hyperphagia by carbamazepine in one patient afflicted with both PWS and Klinefelter's syndrome. Testosterone and behavioral therapy proved to be useful in the management of two patients. The present observations, which are supported by recent advances in the pathophysiology of satiety, suggest that PWS should be understood as a metabolic disorder and subjected to psychopharmacogenetic study.
