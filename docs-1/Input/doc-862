Genetic factors are important in the development of metabolic syndrome. However, the genetic background of metabolic syndrome remains unclear. We screened polymorphisms in 85 obesity-related genes to determine which may be associated with metabolic syndrome. A total of 336 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 85 genes selected from the JSNP database were genotyped. We conducted case-control association analyses using patients with metabolic syndrome (n=1080) and control individuals (n=528) who had no risk of the metabolic syndrome. Three SNPs in the McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKKS) gene were significantly related to metabolic syndrome by case-control association study; rs1545 (odds ratio (OR) adjusted for age and gender, 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21-1.74; P=0.000043 (additive model)); rs1547 (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.21-1.74; P=0.000041); and rs2294901 (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.22-1.75; P=0.000033). We selected five tag SNPs (rs2294901, rs221667, rs6133922, rs6077785 and rs6108572) in the MKKS gene. They were in one linkage disequilibrium (LD) block and rs6133922 (P=0.00042), rs6077785 (P=0.000013) and rs6108572 (P=0.000019) as well as rs2294901 were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome. TGAAA haplotype was protective against the metabolic syndrome (P=0.0074), and CCGTT haplotype was susceptible (P=0.00070) to the metabolic syndrome. Our data suggest that genetic variations at MKKS gene influence the risk of metabolic syndrome.
