The risk of myocardial infarction (MI) is lower in southern than in northern European countries. The lower rate of MI in the Mediterranean regions of Europe suggested a potential role of the traditional Mediterranean diet in the prevention of MI. Unfortunately, in the last 20 years, a tendency to adopt Westernised food habits even in southern regions of Europe is reflected by an increase in the prevalence of obesity. Therefore the impact of diet on MI risk profile among European populations needs to be reconsidered. Genetic risk factors have also been implicated in the development of MI. Genes, indeed, continuously interact with environmental factors in determining the pathogenesis of MI. The aims of the IMMIDIET study are to evaluate: 1. The present dietary habits and the risk profile of three European communities at different risk of MI; 2. The impact of migration on risk factors for MI. Dietary habits and genetic polymorphisms will be evaluated in an Italian, Belgian and British population sample. The historical Italian migration to Belgium and the integration through mixed marriage will be considered as a model of gene-environment interaction. As an index of MI risk profile, factors that are most likely under the combined influence of both dietary and genetic determinants will be investigated.
