The aim of our study was to evaluate whether any association exists between metabolic syndrome (MS) and ACE I/D and AGT M235T gene polymorphisms in Hungarians as an example of European Caucasian population. Study subjects of our cross-sectional study were recruited from the Hungarian General Practitioners' Morbidity Sentinel Stations Program. The study population (n = 1762) approximates very well the age and sex distribution of the general Hungarian population. MS was defined according to the latest diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Diabetes Federation. The frequency of DD genotype (31.36% vs. 25.42%, p = 0.006) and the frequency of D allele (0.56 vs. 0.51, p = 0.006) were significantly higher in the metabolic group than in the non-metabolic group. The distribution of the AGT M235T polymorphism was similar in each group investigated. Association was shown in the case of patients in whom central obesity was combined with elevated TG and low HDL cholesterol level (p = 0.024 and p = 0.022). It suggests that ACE I/D polymorphism is likely to be involved in lipid metabolism.
