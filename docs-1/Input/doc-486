LPIN1 is a gene with important effects on lipidic and metabolic homeostasis. Human subcutaneous LPIN1 expression levels in adipose tissue are related with a better metabolic profile, including insulin sensitivity markers. However, there are few data on the regulation of LPIN1 in visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Our aim was to perform a cross-sectional analysis of VAT compared with subcutaneous (SAT) LPIN1 expression in a well-characterized obese cohort, its relation with the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, and the in vitro response to lipogenic and lipolytic stimuli. A downregulation of total LPIN1 mRNA expression in subjects with obesity was found in VAT similarly to that in SAT. Despite similar total LPIN1 mRNA levels in SAT and VAT, a close relationship with clinical parameters and with many lipogenic and lipolytic genes was observed primarily in SAT depot. As shown in the in vitro analysis, the low-grade proinflammatory environment and the insulin resistance associated with obesity may contribute to downregulate LPIN1 in adipose tissue, leading to a worse metabolic profile.
