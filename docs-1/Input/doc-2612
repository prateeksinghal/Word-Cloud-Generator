We examined the genetic contribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the energy metabolism-related genes, including beta 3 adrenergic receptor (beta3AR), apolipoprotein E (apo-E), promoter of uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3-p), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 (PPARgamma2) and leptin receptor (LEPR) to metabolic disorders, in 118 inhabitants of Palau. The data were statistically analyzed and ethnically compared to correlate SNPs and their metabolic parameters. UCP3-p (P &lt; 0.01) and PPARgamma2 (p = 0.05) correlated with plasma HbA1c, and UCP3-p correlated with fasting blood glucose (P &lt; 0.01) in males, but not in females. UCP3-p correlated with body fat (%) (P &lt; 0.01) in females, but not in males. Plasma leptin levels and apo-E were correlated in both groups. The frequency of SNPs for PPARgamma2, LEPR, and UCP3-p are significantly different between Palauans and Caucasians.
