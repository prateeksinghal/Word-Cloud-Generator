Impaired cellular uptake and utilization of glucose is the hallmark of non-insulin-dependent-diabetes (NIDDM). We have developed a quantitative assay to probe the expression of glucose-transporter genes in tissues derived from patients with NIDDM. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we assessed levels of expression of the insulin responsive glucose transporter GLUT-4 in adipose tissue of patients with NIDDM and in obese patients. We report that expression of GLUT-4 is reduced in NIDDM and in obesity associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. These results suggest that reduction of GLUT-4 levels in the adipose cell plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, an early feature of NIDDM.
