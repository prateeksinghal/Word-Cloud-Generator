Serum leptin levels are elevated in subjects with exogenous obesity, indicating that obesity is associated with leptin resistance. Since in man no abnormalities have yet been found in either the genes for leptin or its receptor, the mechanism of leptin resistance in obesity remains unknown. To determine if resistance might be related to leptin binding by a serum component, we assessed the carrier status of leptin in serum. The presence of a specific leptin binding factor in human serum has been established by (1) demonstrating [125I]-leptin binding to a serum component that is saturable and specifically displaceable only by unlabeled leptin and not by human growth hormone, pork insulin, insulin-like growth factors I and II, luteinizing or follicle stimulating hormones, transforming growth factor-beta 1, interleukin-6, or leukemia inhibiting factor; (2) fractionating the leptin bound serum complex and the serum leptin binding component on a molecular sieving column revealing a mass of approximately 450 kDa; and (3) identifying an inverse correlation between the concentration of serum leptin and the quantity of the leptin binding component. It is suggested that binding of leptin by this serum component may influence the physiologic response to leptin.
