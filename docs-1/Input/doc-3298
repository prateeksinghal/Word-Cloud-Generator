The prevalence of Taql A D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) alleles was determined in 73 obese women and men. In this sample with a mean body mass index of 35.1, the A1 (minor) allele of the DRD2 gene was present in 45.2% of these nonalcohol, nondrug abusing subjects. The DRD2 A1 allele was not associated with a number of cardiovascular risk factors examined, including blood lipids (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]- and low-density lipoprotein [LDL]-cholesterol, and triglycerides). However, phenotypic factors characterized by the presence of parental history and postpuberty onset of obesity as well as carbohydrate preference were associated with obese subjects carrying the A1 allele. The cumulative number of these three factors was positively and significantly (p &lt; .0002) related to A1 allelic prevalence. The data showing an association of the minor allele of the DRD2 gene with phenotypic characteristics suggest that this gene, located on q22-q23 region of chromosome 11, confers susceptibility to a subtype of this disorder.
