Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that identified eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMI highlighted a possible neuronal influence on the development of obesity. We hypothesized these SNPs would govern the response of BMI and subcutaneous fat to resistance training in young individuals (age = 24 years). We genotyped the eight GWAS-identified SNPs in the article by Willer et al. in a cohort (n = 796) that undertook a 12-week resistance-training program. Females with a copy of the rare allele (C) for rs17782313 (MC4R) had significantly higher BMIs (CC/CT: n = 174; 24.70 ± 0.33 kg/m², TT: n = 278; 23.41 ± 0.26 kg/m², P = 0.002), and the SNP explained 1.9% of overall variation in BMI. Males with a copy of the rare allele (T) for rs6548238 (TMEM18) had lower amounts of subcutaneous fat pretraining (CT/TT: n = 65; 156,534 ± 7,415 mm³, CC: n = 136; 177,825 ± 5,139 mm³, P = 0.019) and males with a copy of the rare allele (A) for rs9939609 (FTO) lost a significant amount of subcutaneous fat with exercise (AT/AA: n = 83; -798.35 ± 2,624.30 mm³, TT: n = 47; 9,435.23 ± 3,494.44 mm³, P = 0.021). Females with a copy of the G allele for a missense variant in the SH2B1 (rs7498665) was associated with less change of subcutaneous fat volume with exercise (AG/GG: n = 191; 9,813 ± 2,250 mm³ vs. AA: n = 126; 770 ± 2,772 mm³; P = 0.011). These data support the original finding that there is an association between measures of obesity and a variant near the MC4R gene and extends these results to a younger population and implicates FTO, TMEM18, and SH2B1 polymorphisms in subcutaneous fat regulation.
