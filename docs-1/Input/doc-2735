Data on lipid metabolism in 109 cases of endometrial carcinoma and 33 patients in control are presented. Relevant disorders were detected in 72.5% of the study group [stage I obesity--23 (21.1%); II--29 (26.6%); III--25 (22.9%); IV--2 (1.9%)] which was 1.5 times the mean level in controls (51.5%). The abdominal pattern of obesity was predominant (77.7%). Symptoms of cardiosclerosis were identified in 93 patients with endometrial tumors (85.3%), 93.5% of the latter group presenting with concomitant hyperglyceridemia. In 68.8% of endometrial carcinoma patients, incidence of arterial hypertension was higher than in controls (54.5%). Lipoproteins played a major role in dyslipoproteid pathogenesis involved in obesity and high blood pressure. A study of the insertion-deletion (I/D) polymorphism of apolipoprotein AI genes showed two deletion alleles (DD--6%) and one heterozygote (ID--3%) in control group; no deletion alleles were identified in endometrial tumor patients (0.1 (p(0.05). An investigation of the I/D polymorphism of angiotensin-converting enzyme genes identified deletion homozygotes in 30, insertion homozygotes (II)--27, and heterozygotes--41% (control). In endometrial cancer group, the deletion allele distribution was: DD--29; II--28 and ID--45%. Deletion allele frequency in control was 0.485 while in endometrial carcinoma--0.484 (p(0.05), i.e. with out significant difference.
