The effects of regular physical exercise on obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities vary for each individual. In this study, we investigated whether genotypes of genes associated with obesity can predict the effects of exercise on changes in metabolic markers in healthy men. Healthy Japanese men (n=106) performed the exercise program at 50% of their maximal heart rate for 20-60 min a day, 2-3 days each week for 3 months. The levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and serum leptin significantly decreased after the exercise program. Polymorphisms of the beta3-adrenergic receptor (beta3AR) and uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) genes were analyzed with RFLP methods. In the Trp/Trp genotype of the beta3AR gene, the levels of serum leptin, FPG and fructosamine (FrAm) decreased significantly after the exercise program, but not in the Arg/Arg genotype. In the AG heterozygote and the GG homozygote of the UCP-1 gene, FPG and FrAm levels were significantly reduced, respectively. In conclusion, gene polymorphism of the beta3AR and UCP-1 was found to be associated with the exercise-mediated improvement in glucose tolerance and leptin resistance in healthy Japanese men.
