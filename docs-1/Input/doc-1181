Although used as a therapeutic for 50 years, it is only recently that the application of molecular techniques has provided a basis for understanding growth hormone's (GH) clinical actions. This article reviews progress in our current knowledge of the molecular mechanism of growth hormone (GH) receptor activation based on a number of physicochemical techniques, and documents insights gained into the means used by the activated GH receptor to control the expression of genes regulating growth and metabolism. These findings are related to disorders of short stature, and the therapeutic consequences are summarized.
