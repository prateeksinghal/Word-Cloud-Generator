A genome-wide scan using 387 short tandem repeat markers was conducted for obesity among 618 black individuals from 202 families residing in a suburb of Chicago. Evidence for linkage was evaluated with BMI and percent body fat (PBF) using a variance component analysis approach. Suggestive evidence for linkage was found for BMI on chromosome 5 (logarithm of odds [LOD] score = 1.9) and PBF on chromosome 6 (LOD score = 2.7). One additional region on chromosome 3 was linked to these phenotypes at a lower level of significance (LOD score = 1.8 and 0.95 for BMI and PBF, respectively); the linked marker on this chromosome lies in the same region implicated as harboring obesity genes in a previous study of a white population. The replication of linkage evidence using different ethnic groups reinforces the potential significance of this latter candidate region.
