The number of sodium pump sites on erythrocytes was measured on 1,847 individuals in 80 Utah kindreds ascertained through probands with cardiovascular disease. Likelihood analysis supported recessive inheritance of high pump number. The major locus explained 14.0% of the variance in pump number; polygenic inheritance explained another 63.4%. Homozygotes for the recessive allele occurred with a frequency of 1.74% and had a mean pump number estimated as 566.0 sites/red blood cell (RBC) versus a mean of 312.2 sites/RBC for the other genotypes. Young individuals with the high pump number genotype were leaner, and older adults with the high pump number genotype were heavier. Diabetes and early hypertension were more prevalent in women with the high pump number genotype. Although not significant, obesity in adults of both sexes and early coronary heart disease in men were more prevalent in individuals with the high pump number genotype.
