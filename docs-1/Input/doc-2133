Considerable progress has been accomplished over the past 10 years in the understanding of the genetic basis of obesity and its related metabolic complications. It is now well established that obesity aggregates within families and that genes are partly responsible for this familial aggregation. The number of genes potentially involved in obesity continues to grow. This review summarizes the evidence accumulated so for regarding the contribution of genetic factors in obesity and the number of gene and loci linked to obesity in the Quebec Family Study.
