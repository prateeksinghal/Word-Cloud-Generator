Obesity is a complex trait reflecting numerous genetic and environmental factors. Recently, a common genetic polymorphism (rs7566605) associated with a higher BMI was found in proximity to the insulin induced protein 2 (INSIG2 ) gene, with replication in four unrelated populations living in Western countries. We investigated the susceptibility to the polymorphism amongst the general Japanese population (n = 1976). The frequency of appearance of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Japanese (G allele; 0.652, C allele; 0.348) was not different from that found in subjects of European origin as reported previously. However, the BMI levels in each of these genotypes did not differ significantly (GG; 23 +/- 3, GC; 24 +/- 3, CC; 24 +/- 3 kg/m(2), P = 0.906). In a separate analysis according to sex (male; P = 0.462, female; P = 0.879), age decade (40s; P = 0.057, 50s; P = 0.998, 60s; P = 0.622, 70s; 0.425, respectively), and tertiles of the BMI (1st; P = 0.409, 2nd; P = 0.088, 3rd; P = 0.780), the differences did not achieve statistical significance. The frequency of obesity did not differ among the genotypes (25 kg/m(2); 30.3, 30.8, 28.2%, P = 0.729, 30 kg/m(2); 2.9, 3.8, 2.8%, P = 0.549). No associations were also observed for related plasma markers; high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin (P = 0.510), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (P = 0.788), resistin (P = 0.937) and homeostasis of minimal assessment of insulin resistance (P = 0.634). These results indicate a lack of association between SNP rs7566605 and being overweight among the Japanese (in the middle-aged and elderly population).
