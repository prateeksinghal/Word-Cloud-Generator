Comparative physiology traditionally relies on unusual animals to explore the mechanistic basis or evolution of physiological processes. Despite his credentials as a comparative physiologist, much of the recent work by Peter Hochachka relied upon humans as &quot;comparative&quot; models. Technological advances in clinical analyses and expanding databases of genomic diversity have made humans a very &quot;convenient&quot; model to study the evolution of metabolism. For example, a growing number of metabolic diseases have been shown to have a genetic basis. Obesity, type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome X may each have linkages to polymorphisms in genes encoding transcriptional regulators of bioenergetic genes. Genetic polymorphisms and gene families for these important transcription factors inspire questions about the evolution of energy metabolism in other animals. Thus, these biomedical studies provide important direction for researchers interested in exploring the regulatory basis of interspecies variations in bioenergetics.
