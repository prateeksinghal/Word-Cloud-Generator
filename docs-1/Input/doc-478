Family-based treatments show positive relationships between parent and child weight losses. One mechanism for similar parent-child changes may be a common genetic predisposition to respond similarly to a structured weight loss program. We examined whether concordance of the Taq1 A1 allele of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) predicts similarities in zBMI change in 26 families with obese parents and overweight/obese 8-12-year-old children. Results showed a relationship between parent and child zBMI change over 6 and 12 months (rs=.69, .77, ps&lt;0.001), and concordance for the number of Taq1 A1 alleles predicted the similarity in parent and child weight loss at 6 (p=0.003) and 12 (p=0.025) months. These results show concordance of the Taq1 A1 allele of the DRD2 between parents and children may be one mechanism for the similar response to family-based treatments within families.
