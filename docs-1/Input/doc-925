Subcutaneous and visceral adipose compartments act, not only as fatty acid depots, but also as active endocrine organs that undergo hyperplastic changes and significantly enhance their function in obesity. Akipokines and other proteins secreted by both adipocytes and stromal cells play a central role in peripheral insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (MS). Minor alleles of the adipokine genes substantially contribute to MS. The most important consequence of MS is low-level systemic inflammation supported by adipose-specific synthesis of proinflammatory soluble molecules. Proinflammatory signals are secreted into the bloodstream and spread to peripheral tissues that contain their receptors. The signals provided by adipose tissue stimulate the development of secondary complications of MS, including cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The review describes the physiological effects of adiponectin, leptin, resistin, visfatin, and apelin and the influence of the minor alleles of the adipokine genes on the development of the secondary complications of MS.
