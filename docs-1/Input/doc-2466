Paternally expressed imprinted genes (Pegs) were systematically screened by comparing gene expression profiles of parthenogenetic and normal fertilized embryos using an oligonucleotide array. A novel imprinted gene, Peg12/Frat3, was identified along with 10 previously known Pegs. Peg12/Frat3 is expressed primarily in embryonic stages and might be a positive regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. It locates next to the Zfp127 imprinted gene in the mouse 7C region, which has syntenic homology to the human Prader-Willi syndrome region on chromosome 15q11-q13, indicating that this imprinted region extends to the telomeric side in the mouse.
