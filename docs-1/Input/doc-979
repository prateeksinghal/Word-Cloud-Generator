American Indians have a disproportionately high rate of kidney disease likely due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors. We performed a genome wide scan of estimated glomerular filtration rate in 3665 participants of the Strong Heart Family Study to localize genes influencing kidney disease risk factors. The participants were men and women from 13 American Indian tribes recruited from 3 centers located in Arizona, the Dakotas and Oklahoma. Multipoint variance component linkage analysis was performed for each center and on the entire cohort after controlling for center effects. Modeling strategies that incorporated age, gender and interaction terms (model 1) and another that also controlled for diabetes mellitus, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, low density and high density lipoproteins, triglycerides and smoking status (model 2) were used. Significant evidence for linkage in the Arizona group was found on chromosome 12p12.2 at 39cM (nearest marker D12S310) using model 1. Additional loci with very suggestive evidence for linkage were detected at 1p36.31 for all groups using both models and at 2q33.3 and 9q34.2 for the Dakotas group each using model 1. No significant evidence for additive interaction with diabetes, hypertension or obesity was noted. This evidence for linkage of a quantitative trait locus influencing estimated glomerular filtration rate to a region of chromosome 12p in a large cohort of American Indians will be worth studying in more detail in the future.
