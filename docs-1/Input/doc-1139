Cell death-inducing DFF45-like effectors a and c (CIDEa and CIDEc) are two members of the novel CIDE family of apoptosis-inducing factors. Except as pro-apoptotic proteins, it has been reported that CIDEa and CIDEc could be involved in lipid or fat metabolism. Here we first reported the cDNA cloning, chromosome mapping and expression analysis of CIDEa and CIDEc in pigs. Sequence analysis showed that porcine CIDEa contains an open reading frame of 660 bp, which encodes 219 amino acids, and CIDEc contains a coding region of 717 bp that encodes 238 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of porcine CIDEa and CIDEc shows high similarities to their corresponding human and mouse homologues. Radiation hybrid mapping demonstrated that porcine CIDEa and CIDEc are located at chromosome 6q21-26 and 13q31 respectively, syntenic with the loci of their corresponding homologues on human chromosomes. Tissue distribution analysis indicated that porcine CIDEa and CIDEc mRNAs are co-expressed in various tissues. Both of them were highly expressed in white adipose tissue, and CIDEc mRNA was also expressed at relatively high level in porcine small intestine, lymph and brain. Furthermore, CIDEa and CIDEc mRNA level in white adipose tissues and liver were significantly higher in obese pigs than in their lean counterparts. Our studies provide basic molecular information useful for the further investigation on the function of the two genes, which will be helpful in better understanding of the roles of CIDEs in lipid metabolism.
