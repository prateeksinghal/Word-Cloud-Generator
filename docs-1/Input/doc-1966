Murine NGD5 is a gene identified from NG108-15 cells which is postulated to be involved in opioid receptor function. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a cDNA C20orf9-003 (ACI-1) encoding the human orthologue of the mouse NGD5. Analysis of the genomic structure revealed that C20orf9-003 (ACI-1) contains 13 exons and 12 introns, spanning 52.5kb of genomic DNA and is a variant of C20orf9. Chromosomal localization of human C20orf9-003 (ACI-1) assigned this gene to chromosome 20q13.12. Genes at this locus have been associated with the progression and possibly the development of various cancers. In addition several linkage studies support the possibility that one or more genes affecting obesity are located in 20q13. No function can be clearly assigned to C20orf9-003 (ACI-1), however, the protein has a cytoplasmic subcellular location and the secondary structure contains a Rossman fold like feature which is found in many nucleotide binding proteins.
