Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a multisystemic genetic disease characterized by hypotonia, mental retardation, characteristic facial appearance, hyperphagia, and compulsive eating due to hypothalamic dysfunction. PWS is caused by loss of function of genes located in chromosome 15q11-q13, an area subject to genomic imprinting. Obesity is a major cause of increased morbidity and mortality among patients with PWS. The objective of this study was to analyze the therapeutic options available for the treatment of the obesity in PWS including pharmacological and surgical strategies.
