Over the past year, the mouse has been used as a model to make significant contributions towards our understanding of human developmental disorders. The existence of both natural and artificial mouse mutants has not only facilitated the identification of mutations and provided candidate genes for human disorders but has also increased our knowledge regarding the cellular and molecular processes involved in normal mammalian embryogenesis.
