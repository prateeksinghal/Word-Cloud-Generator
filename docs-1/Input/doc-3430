The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationship between two genetic factors associated with raised blood cholesterol, i.e. familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and apolipoprotein (apo) E4. A group of 50 unrelated heterozygous FH patients aged 33-71 years were studied together with 129 normolipidemic subjects. A significantly higher frequency of apo E4 phenotypes was found in FH patients (30.0%) than in normolipidemic subjects (15.5%). FH patients were divided into two groups with and without apo E4. Plasma total cholesterol (Chol) and triglyceride (TG) levels were significantly higher, and plasma low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-Chol) level tended to be higher in FH patients with apo E4 than in those without apo E4. In addition, the prevalence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) was significantly higher in FH patients with apo E4 (73.3%) than in those without apo E4 (31.4%). No significant difference was noted in age and in the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and smoking between the FH groups with and without apo E4. These results suggest that apo E4 is associated with higher levels of total Chol and TG and, at least in part, contributes to the predisposition to IHD in FH.
