We hypothesized that the mutational strand asymmetry is more strongly exerted upon the mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) gene, which is distant from the origin of the light-strand replication (Ori(L)), than upon the ATPase subunit 6 (ATP6) gene, which is close to the Ori(L). To test this hypothesis, we determined the sequences of these two genes in 96 Japanese young obese adults. The frequency of G--&gt;A transitions was significantly higher than that of C--&gt;T transitions in the Cytb gene, whereas the frequencies of G--&gt;A and C--&gt;T transitions were not significantly different in the ATP6 gene. The marked mutational strand asymmetry in the Cytb gene can be explained by the deamination of C to uracil in the long single-stranded state of the heavy strand during replication. The ratio of the nonsynonymous substitutions at the second codon positions to those at the first codon positions was significantly lower in the Cytb gene than in the ATP6 gene. The physicochemical differences between the standard and the replaced amino acid residues were significantly smaller in the Cytb gene than in ATP6 one. The present study indicates that amino acid sequences are less variable for Cytb than for ATP6 in spite of the strong mutational strand asymmetry for the Cytb gene.
