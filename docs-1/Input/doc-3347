Type 2 diabetes is a familial disease, but recent analysis of nuclear families indicates it is unlikely to be due to a single dominant gene with high penetrance and that it could be polygenic. Insulin resistance is a major feature, with obesity being a major determinant. Beta cell deficiency is a sine qua non of Type 2 diabetes. It is possible that obesity, insulin resistance independent from obesity and impaired beta cell function are independently inherited factors. None of these can be said to be 'primary' as diabetes usually results from the interaction of several geometric and environmental factors. This makes linkage analysis of Type 2 diabetes of uncertain benefit, since heterogeneity can occur within a pedigree. The only mutation so far discovered is of glucokinase producing maturity-onset diabetes of the young, that has a clearly defined and unusual phenotype. Identification of genes that cause classical Type 2 diabetes is likely to come from population association studies, molecular scanning techniques and direct sequencing of candidate genes rather than linkage analysis.
