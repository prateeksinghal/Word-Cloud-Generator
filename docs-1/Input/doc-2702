Five low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR) restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs: TaqI, intron 4; HincII, exon 12; AvaII, exon 13; MspI and NcoI, exon 18) were investigated in 131 individuals from five Brazilian Indian tribes. All markers were polymorphic in this ethnic group. In the whole sample of Amerindians, 13 (41%) of the 32 expected haplotypes were identified, but only three were shared by all tribes. The Xavante, Suruí, Zoró, and Gavião tribes, who had been studied for anthropometry, were grouped according to their genotypes, and the corresponding mean values were examined. Significant associations were observed between HincII *H-, AvaII *A+, MspI *M-, and NcoI *N+ and the body mass index (BMI), triceps and subscapular skinfolds, and the arm fat index (AFI). Haplotypes were derived for these four RFLPs, and (*H-/*A+/*M-/*N+) haplotype carriers were compared with noncarriers of this haplotype with equally significant results for the three parameters (BMI, P=0.021; skinfold thickness, P&lt;0.001; AFI, P=0.005). These results suggest that the LDLR gene has some influence over adipose tissue deposition.
