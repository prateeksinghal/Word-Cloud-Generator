Studies of twins, adopted children, and some human populations indicate that body composition is significantly influenced by genetic factors. However, in no specific instance in either man or animals is the precise etiology of obesity known at the molecular level. Attempts to identify the molecular basis of obesity in humans have been hampered by difficulties in measuring food intake and energy expenditure with sufficient accuracy, as well as the apparent polygenic control of body composition in man. These constraints have stimulated interest in inbred animal strains, particularly mice, that have a genetic predisposition to obesity. Using the techniques of positional cloning, molecular markers flanking two autosomal recessive mouse obesity mutants (ob and db), which demonstrate a metabolic/behavioral phenotype similar to that observed in obese humans, have been identified. These markers are being used: (1) as starting points for chromosome walks to identify these genes, (2) as an aid in identifying genetically obese rodents prior to the development of the experimentally confounding obese phenotype, and (3) to investigate the possible contribution of the ob and db gene products to obesity in families segregating an obese phenotype. Additionally, genetic crosses segregating these obesity mutations are being used to identify &quot;polygenes&quot; that influence the severity of obesity and type II diabetes. Such studies may ultimately lead to the characterization of genes that influence the development and severity of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) in humans.
