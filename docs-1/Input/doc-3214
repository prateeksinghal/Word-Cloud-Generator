Individual susceptibility to obesity is recognized to be influenced significantly by genetic inheritance. Recently, candidate obesity genes have been identified that may contribute to the inheritance of body fat mass and the partitioning of fat between central and peripheral fat depots. In studies of animal models of obesity, the genetic basis for obesity in the obese (Ob/Ob) mouse, the Fat mouse, and the Yellow (Vvy) mouse has been identified. Further research is needed to determine whether abnormalities in these genes contribute to human obesity as well. In studies of humans, sequence variation in at least six genes has been linked to increased body fatness and/or susceptibility to obesity. In addition, five other encoding genes have been linked to a disproportionate storage of fat in the abdominal region. These genes identified in studies of humans are currently thought to be modifying or background genes, each separately conferring a modest increase in susceptibility to fatness. Further research is needed to identify additional candidate genes that confer susceptibility to obesity and to determine the relative importance of each one in a range of human populations with distinct environments.
