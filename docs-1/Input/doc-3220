The ribosomal protein genes are members of multigene families, most of which are processed pseudogenes. Here we report that an intronless pseudogene for the L5 ribosomal protein maps within an intron of the SNRPN transcription unit on human chromosome 15. The pseudogene (RPL5P1) shares 95% sequence homology with the L5 mRNA, has a poly(A) stretch and is flanked by direct repeats.
