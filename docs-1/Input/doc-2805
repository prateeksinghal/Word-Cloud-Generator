We have identified human 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (17beta-HSD 7). The novel human cDNA encodes a 37 kDa protein that shows 78 and 74% amino acid identity with rat and mouse 17beta-HSD 7, respectively. These enzymes are responsible for estradiol production in the corpus luteum during pregnancy, but are also present in placenta and several steroid target tissues (breast, testis and prostate) as revealed by RT-PCR. The human 17beta-HSD 7 gene (HSD17B7) consists of nine exons and eight introns, spanning 21. 8 kb and maps to chromosome 10p11.2 close to susceptibility loci for tumor progression, obesity and diabetes. The HSD17B7 promoter (1.2 kb) reveals binding sites for brain-specific and lymphoid transcription factors corresponding to additional expression domains in hematopoietic tissues and the developing brain as identified by in silico Northern blot.
