The homologues of single genes that cause obesity in rodents are suggested as candidate genes for modulation of body composition in humans. Among these genes are the four mouse mutations-diabetes (db), obesity (ob), tubby (tub), and yellow agouti (Ay). Variation in the human counterparts to these genes (OB, DB, TUB, and ASP, respectively) may contribute to human obesity, which is thought to have a substantial genetic component. To initially assess the potential contribution of these genes to human obesity, we examined polymorphic DNA markers that, by virtue of syntenic relationships to appropriate regions of the mouse genome, should be closely linked to the human counterparts of these genes. Using combined data from 716 Pima Indians comprising 217 nuclear families, we have tested a number of polymorphic microsatellite markers (three at DB, two at OB, five at TUB, and three at ASP) for sib-pair linkage to BMI, percentage body fat, resting metabolic rate, 24-h energy expenditure, and 24-h respiratory quotient. No significant linkages were found in an analysis of all sibships or in an analysis restricted to discordant sib pairs.
