Resistin is a 12.5-kDa cysteine-rich protein secreted from adipose tissue and is an important factor linking obesity with insulin resistance. Here, we investigated the effect of resistin on glucose tolerance in adult human hepatocytes (L-02 cells). In this study, resistin cDNA was transfected into L-02 cells, and glucose concentration and glucokinase activity were determined subsequently. The data indicated resistin impaired, insulin-stimulated glucose utilization, which implied liver was a target tissue of resistin. To understand its molecular mechanism, mRNA levels of key genes in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling pathway were analyzed. The results demonstrated resistin-stimulated expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3), repressed expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) as well as insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2). Given that glucokinase (GK) activity and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) expression were not altered, we presumed that resistin did not effect them. Moreover, resistin lowered mRNA levels of IRS-2 while stimulating SOCS-3 expression, which suggests it impairs glucose tolerance by blocking the insulin signal transduction pathway.
