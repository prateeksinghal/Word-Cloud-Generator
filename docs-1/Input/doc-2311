The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of single nucleotide polymorphism 3 (SNP3) of the apolipoprotein A-V ( APOA5) gene on the serum triglyceride (TG) level in Japanese schoolchildren. To determine the frequency of the genotype, we analyzed 552 schoolchildren. The frequencies of the T/T, T/C and C/C genotypes of the APOA5 gene were 225 (40.8%), 263 (47.6%) and 64 (11.6%), respectively. The serum TG level was significantly different among the genotypic groups after adjustments for age, gender and obesity index (T/T 71.6+/-34.8 mg/dl, T/C 80.7+/-36.1 mg/dl, C/C 94.4+/-69.4 mg/dl, P&lt;0.0001). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for hypertriglyceridemia of the C allele was 2.4 (1.0-6.2). Our data suggested that the T/C promoter region polymorphism of the APOA5 gene appears to be a genetic risk factor for hypertriglyceridemia in Japanese children.
