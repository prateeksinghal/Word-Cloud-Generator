Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a condition associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease. This condition is currently reaching epidemic proportions in the Western world. Epidemiological studies have shown that insulin resistance and the constellation of metabolic alterations associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus such as dyslipidaemia, systemic hypertension, obesity and hypercoagulability, have an effect on the premature onset and severity of atherosclerosis. Albeit direct, the link between insulin resistance and atherogenesis is rather complex. It is likely that its complexity relates to the interaction between genes that predispose to insulin resistance and genes that independently regulate lipid metabolism, coagulation processes and biological responses of the arterial wall. The rapid development of molecular biology in recent years has resulted in a better understanding of the immune and inflammatory mechanisms that underlie insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. For example, it is known that nuclear transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa beta and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor are involved in atherosclerosis. The former modulates gene expression which encodes pro-inflammatory proteins vital for the development of the atheromatous plaque. In the presence of insulin resistance there are multiple activating factors that could explain the early onset and severity of atherosclerosis. Glitazones, the new oral antidiabetic drugs and agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, have been shown to improve peripheral insulin sensitivity and to also delay atherosclerosis progression in experimental models. Their beneficial effects have been linked to their anti-inflammatory effect.
