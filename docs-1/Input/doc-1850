The cardiovascular complications of metabolic syndrome are induced by unfavorable environmental and genetic factors. One of the most important genes under consideration codes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), a nuclear transcription factor which has wide influence on metabolism. The activation of PPARg controls glycemia, lipidemia, adipogenesis, and endothelium function and diminishes insulin resistance. This review discusses the role of the most frequent mutations of the ppargamma gene in metabolic syndrome: Pro467Leu and Val290Met, which are connected with severe insulin resistance, Pro115Gln, which is connected with obesity, and Pro12Ala, which can influence the development of diabetes or hypertension.
