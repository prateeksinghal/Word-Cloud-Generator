The fruit fly Drosophila is a centenarian in research service, but a novice as an invertebrate model system for energy homeostasis research. The last couple of years, however, witnessed numerous technical advances driving the rise of this model organism in central areas of energy balance research such as food perception, feeding control, energy flux and lipometabolism. These studies demonstrate an unanticipated evolutionary conservation of genes and mechanisms governing central aspects of energy homeostasis. Accordingly, research on Drosophila promises both, a systems biology view on the regulatory network, which governs lifelong energy control in a complex eukaryotic organism as well as, important insights into the mammalian energy balance control with a potential impact on the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the treatment of human lipopathologies such as obesity.
