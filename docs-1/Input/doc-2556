Familial genetic studies of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) of different human populations, including the French Caucasians, suggested evidence for linkage of T2DM and human chromosome 20q13, a region where maps the melanocortin 3 receptor gene (MC3R). Likewise, its homologous MC4R in human obesity, MC3R gene is also a good candidate for genetic susceptibility to glucose intolerance and T2DM. We therefore undertook a molecular study to assess the role of genetic variations of this gene in a large cohort of French families with T2DM. In these patients, we identified two missense mutations in the MC3R gene: Val(81)Ile and Lys(6)Thr. These two variants, which were in complete linkage disequilibrium, were also present in nondiabetic controls. Based on association and familial linkage disequilibrium tests results, we found that these MC3R gene-coding variants were not associated with diabetes or obesity. These variants were found, however, marginally associated with insulin and glucose levels during oral glucose tolerance testing in normoglycemic subjects. Overall, the present study provides no evidence for a major role of the MC3R coding mutations underlying the genetic linkages of T2DM and the MC3R gene region on chromosome 20q13 in T2DM families from France and other geographical origins.
