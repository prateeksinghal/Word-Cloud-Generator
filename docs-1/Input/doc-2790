A number of recent reports of linkage of markers on chromosome 10p to schizophrenia, and evidence for linkage in one study to bipolar affective disorder, provide encouragement for psychiatric genetics, after nonreplication of linkage findings at other chromosomal regions. The same region on chromosome 10 also demonstrates evidence for linkage to obesity, female alcoholism, and female type 1 diabetes. However, evidence for linkage can be confounded by the biological phenomenon of transmission ratio distortion. Transmission ratio distortion (also termed segregation distortion or meiotic drive) results in non-Mendelian segregation of alleles to live born offspring, and has not been investigated at the majority of loci for complex traits. We examined evidence for transmission ratio distortion using 40 Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) pedigrees across chromosome 10 using CEPH genotype data. Evidence for linkage of females to D10S211 was found (multipoint non-parametric linkage Z score [NPL] = 1.84, P = 0.040), while there was no linkage of this marker to male sex. The observation of possible transmission ratio distortion in females on chromosome 10p requires additional study, and may impact on the interpretation of positive linkage findings in this region. Am.
