Obesity is commonly associated with high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Weight loss in obese subjects reduces risk factors for CVD but this response is not uniform. Genetic factors could be involved in this variability. The 360His polymorphism of apolipoproteinA-IV (apoA-IV) influences the lipid response to fat intake, but it is unclear whether this polymorphism could contribute to lipid variability during weight loss. Therefore, we assessed the effects of an energy restricted diet (6.3 MJ) for 12 weeks on weight loss and plasma lipids according to apoA-IV genotype in 186 overweight/obese subjects (BMI mean 33+/-4.3, range 25.0-48.0 kg/m(2)). The frequency of the 360His allele was 0.083. Energy restriction for 12 weeks resulted in an average weight loss of 8. 25+/-0.28 kg. HDL-C increased 5.4% in subjects with the apoA-IV-1/1 genotype with weight loss compared to a 2.6% decrease in apoA-IV-1/2 subjects (P=0.035). This was more apparent when only the subjects with type 2 diabetes (n=57) were analyzed (P=0.003). ApoA-IV genotype was not related to change in total cholesterol, LDL-C or triglyceride concentrations. Therefore, weight loss as a treatment to reduce CVD risk factors may be more effective in subjects with the apoA-IV-1/1 variant as compared to those with the apoA-IV-1/2 variant, especially in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
