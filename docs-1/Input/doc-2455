A number of tissues such as the brain must be continuously provided with glucose to meet their energy demand. In contrast, carbohydrate absorption during meals is a discontinuous process. Thus, we must store glucose when its is provided, release it or spare it when it is less abundant. Insulin, secreted by the pancreatic beta-cell is a key hormone in the adaptations of metabolic pathways linked to glucose homeostasis. It inhibits hepatic glucose production, promotes glucose storage in the liver and glucose uptake and storage in muscles and adipose tissues. This is achieved through the modifications of the activity of existing proteins (enzymes, transporters) but also through the regulation of gene expression. In the liver, when the diet is rich in carbohydrates, insulin is secreted and stimulates the expression of genes involved in glucose utilization (glucokinase, L-pyruvate kinase, lipogenic enzymes) and inhibits genes involved in glucose production (phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase). The mechanisms by which insulin controls the expression of these genes were poorly understood. Recently, the transcription factor Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein-1c (SREBP-1c) has been proposed as a key mediator of insulin transcriptional effects. Insulin increases the synthesis and nuclear abundance of this factor which when overexpressed in the liver mimics the effects of insulin on insulin-sensitive genes. This suggests that SREBP-1c could be involved in pathologies such as type 2 diabetes, obesity and more generally in insulin resistance syndromes.
