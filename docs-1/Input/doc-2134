Visceral fat accumulation is accompanied by several metabolic disorders. Here, we investigate the improvement of visceral fat accumulation in the early phase of diet. Hyperlipidemic obese patients received a low-calorie diet (1000 kcal/day) for 14 days. Visceral and subcutaneous fat accumulation was analyzed using ultrasonography. After 14 days of the diet, the average visceral fat of obese patients obviously decreased (P &lt; 0.05), as well as the visceral fat-related secreted proteins, whereas subcutaneous fat did not decrease in these patients. These results show that visceral fat is reduced significantly in the early phase of diet therapy in humans. Therefore, to clarify its mechanism, we analyzed the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes in visceral and subcutaneous fat using obese rats. The Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats, as an obese model, were divided into two groups: fasting and non-fasting. The gene expressions in visceral and subcutaneous fat were measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of beta(3)-adrenergic receptor (AR), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, and uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 genes increased by 3.2-, 2.3-, 2.2-, and 2-fold in visceral fat (P &lt; 0.01), but remained almost unchanged in subcutaneous fat. Taken together, the responsiveness of lipid metabolism-related genes to fasting is more sensitive in visceral fat than in subcutaneous fat in rats, suggesting that the different responsiveness to calorie restriction in fat tissues is due to the different induction of metabolism-related gene expression.
