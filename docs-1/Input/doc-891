Serotonin 2C and 2A receptor (5-HT2C and 5-HT2A) antagonisms are hypothesized to play a role in the metabolic adverse effects induced by olanzapine and clozapine. Associations between polymorphisms in 5-HT2C and 5-HT2A receptor coding genes, HTR2C and HTR2A, with antipsychotic-induced weight gain have been reported. The impact of HTR2C and HTR2A polymorphisms on body mass index (BMI), glucose-insulin homeostasis, and blood lipid levels was evaluated in 46 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and treated with olanzapine (n = 28) or clozapine (n = 18) for at least 6 months. Olanzapine-treated patients with HTR2C haplotype C (-759C, -697C, and 23Ser) had higher BMI (P = 0.029) and C peptide levels (P = 0.029) compared with patients with haplotype B (-759T, -697C, and 23Cys). The frequency of patients homozygous for the HTR2C haplotype A (-759C, -697G, and 23Cys) was significantly higher among clozapine-treated patients with obesity (BMI &gt;/= 30 kg/m) compared with nonobese patients (P = 0.015; odds ratio, 28; 95% confidence interval, 2-380). Patients carrying the HTR2A haplotype 2 (-1438A, 102T, and 452His) had significantly higher C peptide levels compared with haplotype 3 (-1438A, 102T, and 452Tyr) carriers in the olanzapine group (P = 0.034) and in the overall study population (P = 0.019). None of the haplotypes were associated with serum levels of insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol or with homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance. In conclusion, both HTR2C and HTR2A gene polymorphisms seem to be associated with the occurrence of metabolic abnormalities in patients treated with olanzapine or clozapine.
