The high expression of MCH in the hypothalamus with the lean hypophagic phenotype coupled with increased resting metabolic rate and resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity of MCH KO mice has spurred considerable efforts to develop small molecule MCHR1 antagonists. Starting from a lead thienopyrimidinone series, structure-activity studies at the 3- and 6-positions of the thienopyrimidinone core afforded potent and selective MCHR1 antagonists with representative examples having suitable pharmacokinetic properties. Based on structure-activity relationships, a structural model for MCHR1 was constructed to explain the binding mode of these antagonists. In general, a good correlation was observed between pKas and activity in the right-hand side of the template, with Asp123 playing an important role in the enhancement of binding affinity. A representative example when evaluated chronically in diet-induced obese mice resulted in good weight loss effects. These antagonists provide a viable lead series in the discovery of new therapies for the treatment of obesity.
