Our goal was to determine whether differences in apolipoprotein E (apo E) influenced the response to dietary changes aimed at reducing serum cholesterol levels, especially increases in fiber. Apo E phenotype and genotype were determined in 43 men and 24 women who had previously taken part in parallel 2-week metabolic dietary studies involving either wheat bran or oat bran supplementation at a level of 6.8 g fiber/1,000 kcal. Fasting blood lipid measurements had been made at the beginning and end of the 2-week metabolic period. Reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels across both oat and wheat bran diets were significantly different depending on the E allele (P = .048). The LDL cholesterol level reduction for E2 carriers (0.60 +/- 0.14 mmol/L, n = 13) was greater than that for E3 homozygotes (0.21 +/- 0.07 mmol/L, n = 38; P = .014) and E4 carriers (0.28 +/- 0.12 mmol/L, n = 16; P = .09). Only the change in dietary fiber on the oat bran diet was related significantly to the decrease in LDL cholesterol levels (r = -.47, P = .007; n = 32). No such relationship was seen on the wheat bran diet (r = -.010, P = .59; n = 33). Carriers of the E2 allele appear to be more responsive than noncarriers to a dietary change involving increased fiber intake. The data also support a lipid-lowering advantage of oat bran over wheat bran. Current dietary recommendations to reduce serum lipid levels may vary in effectiveness depending on distribution of apo E alleles in the different populations studied.
