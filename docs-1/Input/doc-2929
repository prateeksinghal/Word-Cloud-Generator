Kinesins are a large superfamily of microtubule motors that mediate specific motile processes. In a previous study, we identified 11 kinesin family members in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the striped bass, Morone saxatilus. We have now identified, cloned, and sequenced the human homologue (KIFC3) of the most abundantly expressed retinal kinesin from that study, the C-terminal kinesin FKIF2. An antibody raised against an FKIF2 peptide cross-reacted with an approximately 80-kDa protein in human retina, RPE, kidney, and lung. Since microtubule-dependent processes are critical to the function and morphogenesis of the photoreceptors and RPE, the abundantly expressed KIFC3 was considered to be a potential candidate gene for causing human retinal degeneration. Chromosomal localization of the KIFC3 gene revealed that it maps to chromosome 16q13-q21, within the critical region for a Bardet-Biedl syndrome locus (BBS2). Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinal dystrophy, polydactyly, obesity, hypogonadism, renal abnormalities, and mental retardation. The chromosomal localization and expression pattern of KIFC3 suggest that it may be an excellent candidate for families linked to BBS2.
