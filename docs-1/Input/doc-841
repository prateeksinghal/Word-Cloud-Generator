In this study on 138 Czech Caucasians, the ADIPOQ 45T/G polymorphism was associated with the dietary composition. As the GG homozygotes were associated with the increased intake of carbohydrates, we suggest that a proportion of the prodiabetogenic effect of the polymorphism might be due to its influence on eating behaviour.
