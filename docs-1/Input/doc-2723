In the past few years, there has been exponential growth in our knowledge of genes that control food intake and metabolism. Most of this research has demonstrated either an increased or decreased expression of these &quot;obesity genes&quot; in response to changes in nutritional status. Ultimately, these changes reflect modifications in the rate of gene transcription, mRNA stability, translation initiation, or posttranslational processing. Few laboratories have examined specifically which of these molecular mechanisms are responsible for obesity gene regulation, and thus, the field is wide open for exploration. In addition, it is possible that some forms of human obesity may be caused by inherited mutations in transcription factors or other regulatory molecules rather than base pair mutations in the obesity genes themselves. This article focuses on the regulation of the leptin receptor, NPY, and POMC genes, and explores what is known about the regulation of these obesity genes in response to food intake or changes in body fat stores. Connections between regulation of these genes and some inherited forms of human obesity are made.
