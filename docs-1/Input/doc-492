Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) have powerful stimulatory effects on food intake, which suggests that the downregulation of brain NPY or AgRP may help reduce obesity and diabetes by inhibiting food intake. To search for active compounds that inhibit NPY and AgRP expression, we made two luciferase reporter assay systems consisting of NPY and AgRP promoter-driven luciferase genes, together with the puromycin resistance gene, in a plasmid vector. Each plasmid was permanently transfected into N29-4 neuronal cells. Using the systems, resveratrol was purified from the stem of Vitis coignetiae Pulliat by activityguided fractionation. Resveratrol downregulated NPY and AgRP promoter-driven luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory concentrations (IC(50), 50% inhibition) of resveratrol against pNPY-luc and pAgRP-luc activities were 8.9 microM and 8.0 microM, respectively. Furthermore, one-time intraperitoneal injection of resveratrol (100 mg/kg) suppressed 20.0% and 17.2% of food intake during 24 and 48 h, respectively. These results indicated that resveratrol inhibited food intake, which may be related to the downregulation of NPY and AgRP gene expression.
