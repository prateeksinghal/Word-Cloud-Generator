Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is one of the most common non-communicable diseases in the world. It has become obvious that NIDDM is the result of a collision between thrifty genes and an affluent society. Genes predisposing to NIDDM might have been survival genes for our ancestors, helping them to store energy during long periods of starvation. When these genes are exposed to a sedentary lifestyle and high caloric intake typical to the Western world, they predispose to obesity and insulin resistance. NIDDM results when beta cells cannot compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion. Therefore, at least two inherited defects can be expected in NIDDM, one causing obesity and insulin resistance and the other inability to increase insulin secretion. In reality there may be more inherited defects. It has become quite clear that diabetes cannot simply be divided into NIDDM and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The disease is more heterogeneous; unmasking this heterogeneity and identifying new subgroups of diabetes presents a challenge to modern molecular biology.
