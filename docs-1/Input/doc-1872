Saturated fat plays a role in common debilitating diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. It is also clear that certain fatty acids act as regulators of metabolism via both direct and indirect signalling of target tissues. As the molecular mechanisms of saturated fatty acid signalling in the liver are poorly defined, hepatic gene expression analysis was undertaken in a human hepatocyte cell line after incubation with palmitate. Profiling of mRNA expression using cDNA microarray analysis revealed that 162 of approximately 18,000 genes tested were differentially expressed after incubation with palmitate for 48 h. Altered transcription profiles were observed in a wide variety of genes, including genes involved in lipid and cholesterol transport, cholesterol catabolism, cell growth and proliferation, cell signalling, beta-oxidation, and oxidative stress response. While palmitate signalling has been examined in pancreatic beta-cells, this is the first report showing that palmitate regulates expression of numerous genes via direct molecular signalling mechanisms in liver cells.
