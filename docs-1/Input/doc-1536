Like many diseases, the causes of obesity are complex, and their investigation requires novel approaches. Given the many contributors to our weight status, as well as the dynamic nature, genomic tools must be applied in an ecological model. Evaluating disparate factors can be difficult, such as feeding behavior, nutritional genomics, and gene-environment interaction. Many of these behaviors are being evaluated in animal models and hold great promise for targeted interventions in the future.
