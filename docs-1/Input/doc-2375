Susceptibility genes present in both mother and fetus most likely contribute to the risk of pre-eclampsia. Placental biopsies were therefore investigated by high-density DNA microarray analysis to determine genes differentially regulated within chorionic villous tissue in pre-eclampsia and normal pregnancy. The pooled RNAs of pre-eclamptic and normotensive subjects were hybridized to the HuGeneFL array representing sequences from approximately 5600 full-length human cDNAs. The differentially expressed genes that were detected could be categorized into nine groups: adhesion molecules, obesity-related genes, transcription factors/signalling molecules, immunological factors, neuromediators, oncogenic factors, protease inhibitors, hormones and growth factor-binding proteins. Among those, the obesity-related genes included putative candidate genes associated with the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. One of the most up-regulated transcripts was the obese gene (43.6-fold change), and this was reflected by elevated leptin protein levels. In the case of feto-maternal contribution of polymorphic genes to pre-eclampsia, expression analysis of placental tissue has lead to numerous target genes waiting for large scale genetic linkage analyses.
