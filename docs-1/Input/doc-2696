Insulin resistance has been described as a possible underlying link for the clustering of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia, known as the metabolic syndrome. Mutations within the insulin receptor have been associated with hypertension in some white and Oriental populations. We examined the relationship between the insulin receptor NsiI restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) and biochemical and anthropometric parameters associated with these disorders in 933 Chinese subjects. Of the 933 subjects, 117 were control subjects and 816 had one or more components of the metabolic syndrome: 59.7% hypertension, 64.6% glucose intolerance, 55.3% dyslipidemia, and 53.3% obesity. The prevalences of the N1 allele and N1N1 genotype were 74.4% and 55.8%, respectively, in the whole population. No differences were observed in the genotype and allele frequency distributions between the control group and the cohorts with glucose intolerance, hypertension, or dyslipidemia alone or in combination. Using one-way ANOVA, there was a weak relationship between the insulin receptor genotypes and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), P = .069. The DBP was significantly higher in subjects carrying the N1N1 genotype in both the total population (80 +/- 13 v 76 +/- 12 mm Hg, P = .038) and subjects with glucose intolerance (80 +/- 12 v 76 +/- 10 mm Hg, P = .048). Using stepwise multiple regression, the insulin receptor NsiI polymorphism was found to be an independent predictor of DBP in this Chinese population, P = .018. Age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) were also included in the analysis and were all significantly associated with diastolic DBP. To conclude, the insulin receptor gene NsiI RFLP is associated with DBP in these Chinese subjects.
