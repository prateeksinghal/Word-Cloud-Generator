TWEAK, a cytokine of the TNF family, has been found to be expressed under different inflammatory conditions but no data is available concerning the expression of this cytokine and its receptor (Fn14) in human obesity. In the present work we have evaluated the expression of many pro-inflammatory TNF system cytokines (TNF-alpha, TWEAK and their respective receptors, TNFR1, TNFR2 and Fn14) in human adipose tissue of 84 subjects some with different degree of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and its relation with inflammation by also measuring the expression of macrophage marker CD68. We detected expression of TWEAK and Fn14 in isolated mature adipocytes and in the stromovascular fraction. Additionally, we found that LPS upregulates the expression of both genes on THP-1 human monocytic cell line. TWEAK was expressed in adipose tissue of all studied subjects with no differences between obesity group, and was associated with Fn14 expression in morbid obese, mainly in women with type 2 diabetes. The data obtained here also showed that TNF-alpha and TNFR2 mRNAs were significantly more expressed in subcutaneous adipose tissue of subjects with morbid obesity compared to obese and non-obese subjects. In contrast, TNFR1 gene expression was negatively associated with BMI. Our results suggest that the expression of TNF-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased in severe obesity, where macrophage infiltrate could modulate the inflammatory environment through activation of its receptors.
