The contribution of genetic factors to the development of obesity has been widely recognized, but the identity of the genes involved has not yet been fully clarified. Variation in genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and energy metabolism is expected to have a role in the etiology of obesity. We assessed the potential association of a polymorphism in one candidate gene, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARGgamma), involved in these pathways and obesity-related phenotypes in 335 Brazilians of European descent. All individuals included in the sample were adults. Pregnant women, as well as those individuals with secondary hyperlipidemia due to renal, liver or thyroid disease, and diabetes, were not invited to participate in the study; all other individuals were included. The gene variant PPARG Pro12Ala was studied by a PCR-based method and the association between this genetic polymorphism and obesity-related phenotypes was evaluated by analysis of covariance. Variant allele frequency was PPARG Ala12 = 0.09 which is in the same range as described for European and European-derived populations. No statistically significant differences were observed for mean total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglyceride levels among PPARG genotypes in either gender. In the male sample, an association between the PPARG Pro12Ala variant and body mass index was detected, with male carriers of the Ala variant presenting a higher mean body mass index than wild-type homozygotes (28.3 vs 26.2 kg/m2, P = 0.037). No effect of this polymorphism was detected in women. This finding suggests that the PPARG gene has a gender-specific effect and contributes to the susceptibility to obesity in this population.
