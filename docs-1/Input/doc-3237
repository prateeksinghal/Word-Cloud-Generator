Mutant alleles of the agouti gene cause obesity in the mouse and the homologous gene in humans has been mapped to chromosome 20q11.2. An allelic variant of the agouti gene could account for obesity in humans and we tested this hypothesis by genotyping 210 sibling pairs from 45 families segregating an obesity phenotype. Using sibling pair linear regression analysis, evidence for linkage between obesity and markers flanking the agouti locus and other markers spanning chromosome 20q was assessed. We found no correlation between identity-by-descent at these markers and obesity differences within pairs. In the mouse, obesity caused by mutations of the agouti gene develops later in life, so a subset of families with adult-onset obesity were also tested for linkage, with negative results. Although it is not possible to exclude alleles of the agouti gene as a contributor to obesity in humans, the absence of positive linkage in this study suggests that either the agouti gene has small effects or the allele frequency is low.
