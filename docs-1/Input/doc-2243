While human diets have markedly evolved since their origin, the human genome has only marginally changed. Nevertheless, polymorphisms of common genes are widespread. It has been substantiated that most major diseases (including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and cancers) result from the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, including diet. In the field of lipoprotein metabolism and cardiovascular disease several gene polymorphisms for key proteins, such as apoproteins (apo) E, B, A-IV and C-III, LDL receptor, microsomal transfer protein (MTP), fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase, have been identified and linked to variable responses to diets. We are carrying out an intervention study (RIVAGE) in Marseille dedicated to investigating the interactions between diets (Mediterranean or low-fat types v. standard Western type), risk factors for cardiovascular disease and gene polymorphisms in about 300 patients randomized into two groups over periods of 3 and 12 months. Some data obtained in about 100 patients after 3 months of dietary change are available. Among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) already studied (apoE (epsilon2, epsilon3, epsilon4), apoB (-516C/T), apoC-III (SstI), apoA-IV (Ser347Thr), MTP (-493G/T), intestinal FABP (Ala54Thr), CETP (TaqIB) and hepatic lipase (-480C/T)), some SNP showed interactions with diets in relation to changes in particular variables after 3 months on the dietary regimens. This was the case for apoE and LDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerols, apoA-IV and LDL-cholesterol, MTP and LDL-cholesterol, intestinal FABP and triacylglycerols. These data provide evidence of the interaction between some SNP and the metabolic response to diets.
