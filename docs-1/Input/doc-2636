Balanced translocations affecting the paternal copy of 15q11--q13 are a rare cause of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) or PWS-like features. Here we report on the cytogenetic and molecular characterization of a de novo balanced reciprocal translocation t(X;15)(q28;q12) in a female patient with atypical PWS. The translocation breakpoints in this patient and two previously reported patients map 70-80 kb distal to the SNURF-SNRPN gene and define a breakpoint cluster region. The breakpoints disrupt one of several hitherto unknown 3' exons of this gene. Using RT--PCR we demonstrate that sequences distal to the breakpoint, including the recently identified C/D box small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) gene cluster HBII-85 as well as IPW and PAR1, are not expressed in the patient. Our data suggest that lack of expression of these sequences contributes to the PWS phenotype.
