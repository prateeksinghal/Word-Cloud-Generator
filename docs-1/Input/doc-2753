Bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS-3) is one of the candidate genes of obesity. The mice lacking BRS-3 have been shown to develop mild obesity. These mice also showed hypertension and impaired glucose metabolism, supporting these mice as a good model for human obesity. We screened 104 Japanese obese men (BMI &gt; 26.4, 26.5-44.1) to investigate whether there is any genetic defect in BRS-3 gene. The DNA fragments containing each exon of BRS-3 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were directly sequenced. No mutation, nor polymorphism was found in the coding region of BRS-3, suggesting that mutation of this gene is not a major cause of obesity in humans.
