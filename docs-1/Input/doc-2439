Dietary digestible carbohydrates are able to modulate lipogenesis, by modifying the expression of genes coding for key lipogenic enzymes, like fatty acid synthase. The overall objective of the Nutrigene project (FAIR-CT97-3011) was to study the efficiency of various carbohydrates to modulate the lipogenic capacity and relevant gene expression in rat and human species (control and obese subjects) and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of lipogenic genes by carbohydrates. Key cellular mediators (namely SREBP-1c and 2, AMP activated protein kinase, cholesterol content) of the regulation of lipogenic gene expression by glucose and/or insulin were identified and constitute new putative targets in the development of plurimetabolic syndrome associated with obesity. In humans, hepatic lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis, assessed in vivo by the use of stable isotopes, was promoted by a high-carbohydrate diet in non obese subjects, and in non alcoholic steatotic patients, but was not modified in the adipose tissue of obese subjects. Non digestible/fermentable carbohydrates, such as fructans, were shown to decrease hepatic lipogenesis in non obese rats, and to lessen hepatic steatosis and body weight in obese Zucker rats. If confirmed in obese humans, this would allow the development of functional food able to counteract the metabolic disturbances linked to obesity.
