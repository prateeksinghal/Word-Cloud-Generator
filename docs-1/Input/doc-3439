Serum C-peptide (CP) and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) responses were studied in 47 euglycemic offspring of patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Mean IRI responses were not significantly different in nonobese offspring of MODY patients (O-MODY) but they were lower in obese O-MODY than in respective controls. Mean CP responses were low in both groups, the change being more pronounced in obese O-MODY. These findings indicate that alterations of secretion and metabolism of insulin can be detected even before glucose intolerance is seen in O-MODY.
