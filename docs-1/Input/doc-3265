Insulin resistance is believed to be a prediabetic condition that results from reduced rates of insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle. A decrease in activities of skeletal muscle glycogen synthase and of its regulatory enzyme type-1 protein phosphatase (PP 1) have been previously identified in insulin-resistant Pima Indians. Because the PP1 catalytic beta-subunit is presumed to be the major isoform in the glycogen-bound PP1 complex, we have selected the structural gene for this subunit (PPP1CB) as a candidate for a detailed genetic analysis. We have determined the exon-intron structure of PPP1CB, and have identified a polymorphic (CA)-repeat marker (D2S1237) at this gene. No sequence abnormalities were detected in PPP1CB by Southern blot analysis or by single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis of all eight coding exons. Using sib-pair linkage analyses, no evidence for linkage was found between the D2S1237 marker at this locus and fasting insulin, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in vivo, obesity, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Similarly, we have found no evidence for association of D2S1237 with any of these phenotypes. Based on our data we conclude that the structural gene for the PP1 catalytic beta-subunit does not appear to be a major genetic determinant responsible for the PP1 abnormalities characteristic of insulin resistance in Pima Indians.
