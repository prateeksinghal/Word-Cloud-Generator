Adipose tissue is increasingly recognized as a metabolically active endocrine organ with multiple functions beyond its lipid storage capability. Various constituents of the tissue, such as mature adipocytes and stromal vascular cells, have distinct functions. For example, they express and secrete different kinds of bioactive molecules collectively called adipokines. Altered adipokine secretion patterns characterize obesity and insulin resistance, which are major risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The contribution of dysregulated adipokine expression to these diseases may be assembled from transcriptomic profiles of the tissue and/or its cellular constituents. The gene expression profiles may also complement genetic approaches to identify disease susceptibility genes. Here, we describe an application of gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays to study human adipose tissue, adipocytes, and stromal vascular cells.
