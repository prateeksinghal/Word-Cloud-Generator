A large body of evidence demonstrates depot-specific differences in the expression of genes coding important functional proteins in adipocytes. This may contribute to the well-known specific functional properties of the adipocytes from intra-abdominal and subcutaneous regions. This review will focus on the main findings regarding the regional differences in adipocyte gene expression in humans. These genes encode proteins belonging to three different functional groups: the metabolic enzyme and related signalling proteins, the adipogenic factors, and, finally, the products of adipocytes.
