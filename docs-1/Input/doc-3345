RFLPs at the low density lipoprotein receptor locus (LDLR) display marked linkage disequilibrium between each other. Cross-sectional analysis of a bi-alleleic ApaLI RFLP of LDLR showed that the 9.4- and 6.6-kb alleles were present in similar frequency between a group of 84 Caucasian essential hypertensive (HT) and a group of 96 normotensive subjects whose parents each had a similar blood pressure status at age &gt; or = 50. After subdividing HTs into lean and obese, however, the frequency of the 6.6-kb allele in the 27 HTs with BMI &gt; or = 26 kg/m2 was 0.63, compared with 0.39 for HTs with BMI &lt; 26 (chi 2 = 8.8; P = 0.004). The difference in genotype frequencies was even more striking (chi 2 = 23; P = 0.00008), with a virtual absence of 9.4-kb homozygotes in the obese HT group (1 vs 22). Genetic variation at LDLR (19p13.2) is thus associated with obesity in HT.
