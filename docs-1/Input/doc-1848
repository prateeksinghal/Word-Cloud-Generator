Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) is the nuclear receptor responsible for regulating genes that control lipid homeostasis. Because of this role, PPARalpha has become a target of interest for the development of drugs to treat diseases such as dyslipidemia, obesity, and atherosclerosis. Assays currently employed to determine potency and efficacy of potential drug candidates typically utilize a truncated form of the native receptor, one which lacks the entire N-terminal region of the protein. The amino terminus, containing the regions that encode the ligand-independent activation function AF-1 and DNA binding domains, is highly structured and contributes significantly to the overall tertiary structure of the native protein. We report that differences in PPARalpha full-length and ligand binding domain constructs result in differences in binding affinity for coactivator peptides but have little effect on potency of agonists in both cell-free and cell-based nuclear receptor assays.
