To identify genes that influence plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density and low-density lipoproteins concentrations we conducted a genome-wide scan using 354 polymorphic markers spaced at 10-cM intervals in 75 obese but otherwise normal human families. The results of the genome scan using sibling pair analysis of quantitative phenotypes suggested that 1q21-q23 contains a locus that influences plasma cholesterol concentration. Chromosome 12 gave evidence of linkage to plasma triglyceride concentration (D12SPAH) and chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 17, and 20 yielded additional evidence of linkage for lipid phenotypes at lower levels of statistical significance. Allele sharing for markers near prominent candidate genes was either very weakly related or unrelated to sibling similarity for lipid concentrations. Together these results suggest that genes with important roles in regulating normal cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations do not coincide with the location of previously known candidate genes.
