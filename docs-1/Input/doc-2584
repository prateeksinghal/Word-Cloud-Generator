Type 2 diabetes is a multifactorial disease composed of subtypes strongly associated with environmental factors at one end of the spectrum and highly genetic forms at the other hand. The former forms have been largely elucidated in the last years by the identification of the 5 genes responsible for the autosomal dominant MODY subtype: glucokinase, and 4 transcription factors which play a key role in the development of the endocrine pancreas or in the expression of glucose metabolism genes. Apart from the monogenic forms of type 2 diabetes little is known about the nature of the genetic factors involved. Minor contributors include insulin, sulfamide receptor and some others. Genome scans of diabetic families have revealed susceptibility loci on chromosome 1q, 2p, 2q (where the gene calpain 10 was recently cloned), 3q, 12q and 20. The identification of diabetes susceptibility gene is the first step to define targets of new drugs against diabetes.
