Obesity is one of the most commonly identified factors for the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Adipose tissue is the source of many cytokines, among them there are IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-alpha. The level of inflammatory cytokines increases in people with OSAS and obesity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of genotypes in inflammatory cytokine genes in people with obesity-related OSAS. The examined group consisted of 102 person with obesity related-OSAS and 77 normal weight person without OSAS. Genotyping of DNA sequence variation was carried out by restriction enzyme (IL-1: Taq I, IL-6: Lwe I, TNF-alpha: Nco I) analysis of PCR amplified DNA. The study revealed a significant correlation between polymorphism located in the promoter region of inflammatory cytokine genes and obesity-related OSAS.
