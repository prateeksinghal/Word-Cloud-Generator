In this chapter, we summarize our studies on plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), tissue factor, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) expression in obesity, using genetically obese mice as a model. These studies emphasize the key role played by the adipocyte, a cell whose numbers, size, and metabolic activity are grossly altered in obesity/NIDDM. They also implicate multiple cytokines, hormones, and growth factors in the abnormal expression of these and perhaps other hemostatic genes by adipocytes in obesity/NIDDM. These studies demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a central role in the expression of hemostatic genes in this disorder.
