The last decade has witnessed the development of multiple microarray platforms designed to study, in a comprehensive fashion, the expression and sequence of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes that encode mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in a number of severe medical conditions including cancer, metabolic diseases (i.e., cardiovascular, diabetes and obesity) and neurodegenerative disorders and it is responsible for the adverse effects of numerous drugs. Profiling of the genetic and genomic status of mitochondria with focused microarrays offers the promise of rapidly and robustly identifying novel biomarkers for early disease diagnoses and prognoses, predicting of drug safety, liability, and selecting and stratifying of patients in clinical trials.
