Over the last decade, C-reactive protein concentration analyzed by the high sensitivity method (hsCRP) has been proven as a marker of premature atherosclerosis. Concentration exceeding 2 mg/l represents an increased individual risk of myocardial infarction and stroke but strict application of this borderline is complicated by relations of CRP concentrations to other risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. In a large 1 % representative sample of the Czech population, a positive relation of hsCRP to BMI, a waist circumference and triglyceride concentration was documented. Substantial sex differences were found in its relationship to age. Whereas it is continuously increasing in men, this increase appears in women only after menopause. A substantial decrease of body weight and visceral fat volume by increased physical activity is accompanied by significant decrease of hsCRP in young obese women. This decrease was not related to a change of interleukin-6 concentration, although it is supposed to regulate CRP production. CRP concentration is partly under genetic control as a higher concentration in young siblings of probands with proved coronary atherosclerosis was documented. The participation of genes related to lipoprotein metabolism (genes for apolipoprotein CI and apolipoprotein E) influence hsCRP concentrations. We hypothesized that an increased concentration of hsCRP represents a certain marker of proinflammatory status related to central obesity and triglyceride metabolism and it might be related to individual properties of monocytes in atherogenesis.
