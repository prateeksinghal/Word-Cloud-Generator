Obesity is an important risk factor for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS), insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. The substitution of tryptophan 64 with arginine (Trp64Arg) polymorphism (Arg variant) of the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) has been associated with obesity. In this study, the prevalence of the Trp64Arg ADRB3 polymorphism in a large group of patients with OSAS and its association with body mass index (BMI), insulin resistance and hypertension were evaluated. ADRB3 genotype was determined in 387 patients with OSAS and 137 healthy subjects recruited from three Spanish tertiary hospitals. The distributions of the ADRB3 genotypes were similar in OSAS and controls, and, in a multivariate model, the risk of OSAS was not associated with the presence of the Arg variant of the ADRB3 gene. However, BMI was higher in those patients with OSAS who carried this genetic variant than in those with the Trp variant. Furthermore, a linear trend for higher BMI was found in those with the Arg variant (56, 75 and 100% for Trp/Trp, Trp/Arg and Arg/Arg, respectively). Insulin resistance, blood pressures and serum levels of lipids and glucose were not associated with the presence of the Arg variant of the ADRB3 gene. The presence of the arginine 64 allele of the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor gene does not increase the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, but is associated with the development of obesity in those patients who suffer obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.
