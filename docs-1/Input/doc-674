The leptin receptor was discovered as a leptin binding protein, which is highly expressed in the choroid plexus. Mapping of the gene's chromosomal locations in rodents revealed that mutations in Lepr were the basis of obesity/diabetes mutations in rodents and humans. Genetic manipulations that target Lepr expression in specific neurons or hypothalamic areas have generated insights into the modes by which body composition and reproductive function are modulated by the leptin receptor. These animal models have also been instrumental in identifying diabetes susceptibility genes. In this review we discuss the evidence that supports the concept of networked functions of leptin receptor as it pertains to feeding, substrate utilization and reproduction.
