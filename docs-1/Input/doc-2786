The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) gene has been implicated in morbid obesity and is important to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. However, the relevance of gene variations in healthy nonobese subjects has not been defined. We recruited monozygotic and dizygotic healthy nonobese twin subjects to test the hypothesis that the PPARgamma gene is important to body mass index and lipid concentrations in healthy nonobese subjects. Both linkage and association strategies were used in the same dizygotic twins. The PPARgamma gene locus was linked (P&lt;0.01) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and body mass index as quantitative traits. A biallelic variant in the PPARgamma gene was associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and body mass index (P&lt;0.05). We also looked for linkage between the same variables and the retinoic X receptor gene locus. This locus was linked to total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as triglycerides. We conclude that the PPARgamma gene is highly relevant to lipid metabolism and body mass index, not only in the morbidly obese but also in healthy nonobese subjects. The same appears to be true for its binding partner. Sequencing these genes in twins would serve to identify gene variations contributing to body mass index and lipid concentrations in healthy nonobese subjects.
